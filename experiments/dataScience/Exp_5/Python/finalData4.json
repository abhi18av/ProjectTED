It is.\nIt's an aging movie star,\ngrappling with all\nthe newness around itself,\nwondering whether\nit got it right in the first place,\nand still trying to find a way\nto keep on shining regardless.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nI was born in a refugee colony\nin the capital city of India, New Delhi.\nAnd my father was a freedom fighter.\nMy mother was, well,\njust a fighter like mothers are.\nAnd much like the original homo sapiens,\nwe struggled to survive.\nWhen I was in my early 20s,\nI lost both my parents,\nwhich I must admit\nseems a bit careless of me now,\nbut —\n\n\n\n 2:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:08\n\n\nI do remember the night my father died,\nand I remember the driver of a neighbor\nwho was driving us to the hospital.\nHe mumbled something\nabout \"dead people don't tip so well\"\nand walked away into the dark.\nAnd I was only 14 then,\nand I put my father's dead body\nin the back seat of the car,\nand my mother besides me,\nI started driving back\nfrom the hospital to the house.\nAnd in the middle of her quiet crying,\nmy mother looked at me and she said,\n\"Son, when did you learn to drive?\"\nAnd I thought about it\nand realized, and I said to my mom,\n\"Just now, Mom.\"\n\n\n\n 2:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nSo from that night onwards,\nmuch akin to humanity in its adolescence,\nI learned the crude tools of survival.\nAnd the framework of life was\nvery, very simple then, to be honest.\nYou know, you just ate what you got\nand did whatever you were told to do.\nI thought celiac was a vegetable,\nand vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's\nlost comrade in \"Star Trek.\"\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:09\n\n\nYou married the first girl that you dated,\nand you were a techie if you could fix\nthe carburetor in your car.\nI really thought that gay was\na sophisticated English word for happy.\nAnd Lesbian, of course, was the capital\nof Portugal, as you all know.\n\n\n\n 3:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\nWhere was I?\nWe relied on systems\ncreated through the toil and sacrifice\nof generations before\nto protect us,\nand we felt that governments\nactually worked for our betterment.\nScience was simple and logical,\nApple was still then just a fruit\nowned by Eve first and then Newton,\nnot by Steve Jobs, until then.\nAnd \"Eureka!\" was what you screamed\nwhen you wanted\nto run naked on the streets.\nYou went wherever life took you for work,\nand people were mostly welcoming of you.\nMigration was a term then\nstill reserved for Siberian cranes,\nnot human beings.\nMost importantly, you were who you were\nand you said what you thought.\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nThen in my late 20s,\nI shifted to the sprawling\nmetropolis of Mumbai,\nand my framework,\nlike the newly industrialized\naspirational humanity,\nbegan to alter.\nIn the urban rush for a new,\nmore embellished survival,\nthings started to look a little different.\nI met people who had descended\nfrom all over the world,\nfaces, races, genders, money-lenders.\nDefinitions became more and more fluid.\nWork began to define you at that time\nin an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,\nand all the systems\nstarted to feel less reliable to me,\nalmost too thick to hold on\nto the diversity of mankind\nand the human need to progress and grow.\nIdeas were flowing\nwith more freedom and speed.\nAnd I experienced the miracle\nof human innovation and cooperation,\nand my own creativity,\nwhen supported by the resourcefulness\nof this collective endeavor,\ncatapulted me into superstardom.\n\n\n\n 5:16\n\n\nI started to feel that I had arrived,\nand generally, by the time I was 40,\nI was really, really flying.\nI was all over the place.\nYou know? I'd done 50 films by then\nand 200 songs,\nand I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.\nI had been given the highest civil honor\nby the French government,\nthe title of which for the life of me\nI can't pronounce even until now.\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:37\n\n\nI'm sorry, France, and thank you,\nFrance, for doing that.\nBut much bigger than that,\nI got to meet Angelina Jolie —\n\n\n\n 5:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\nfor two and a half seconds.\n\n\n\n 5:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nAnd I'm sure she also remembers\nthat encounter somewhere.\nOK, maybe not.\nAnd I sat next to Hannah Montana\non a round dinner table\nwith her back towards me most of the time.\nLike I said, I was flying,\nfrom Miley to Jolie,\nand humanity was soaring with me.\nWe were both pretty much\nflying off the handle, actually.\n\n\n\n 6:10\n\n\nAnd then you all know what happened.\nThe internet happened.\nI was in my late 40s,\nand I started tweeting\nlike a canary in a birdcage\nand assuming that, you know,\npeople who peered into my world\nwould admire it\nfor the miracle I believed it to be.\nBut something else\nawaited me and humanity.\nYou know, we had expected\nan expansion of ideas and dreams\nwith the enhanced\nconnectivity of the world.\nWe had not bargained\nfor the village-like enclosure of thought,\nof judgment, of definition\nthat flowed from the same place\nthat freedom and revolution\nwas taking place in.\nEverything I said took a new meaning.\nEverything I did — good, bad, ugly —\nwas there for the world\nto comment upon and judge.\nAs a matter of fact,\neverything I didn't say or do also\nmet with the same fate.\n\n\n\n 7:07\n\n\nFour years ago,\nmy lovely wife Gauri and me\ndecided to have a third child.\nIt was claimed on the net\nthat he was the love child\nof our first child\nwho was 15 years old.\nApparently, he had sown\nhis wild oats with a girl\nwhile driving her car in Romania.\nAnd yeah, there was\na fake video to go with it.\nAnd we were so disturbed as a family.\nMy son, who is 19 now,\neven now when you say \"hello\" to him,\nhe just turns around and says,\n\"But bro, I didn't even have\na European driving license.\"\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nYeah.\nIn this new world,\nslowly, reality became virtual\nand virtual became real,\nand I started to feel\nthat I could not be who I wanted to be\nor say what I actually thought,\nand humanity at this time\ncompletely identified with me.\nI think both of us\nwere going through our midlife crisis,\nand humanity, like me,\nwas becoming an overexposed prima donna.\nI started to sell everything,\nfrom hair oil to diesel generators.\nHumanity was buying everything\nfrom crude oil to nuclear reactors.\nYou know, I even tried\nto get into a skintight superhero suit\nto reinvent myself.\nI must admit I failed miserably.\nAnd just an aside I want to say\non behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men\nand Supermen of the world,\nyou have to commend them,\nbecause it really hurts in the crotch,\nthat superhero suit.\n\n\n\n 8:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:40\n\n\nYeah, I'm being honest.\nI need to tell you this here.\nReally.\nAnd accidentally, I happened\nto even invent a new dance form\nwhich I didn't realize,\nand it became a rage.\nSo if it's all right,\nand you've seen a bit of me,\nso I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.\nIt was called the Lungi dance.\nSo if it's all right, I'll just show you.\nI'm talented otherwise.\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\n(Cheers)\n\n\n\n 9:02\n\n\nSo it went something like this.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi.\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nThat's it. It became a rage.\n\n\n\n 9:14\n\n\n(Cheers)\n\n\n\n 9:15\n\n\nIt really did.\nLike you notice, nobody could make\nany sense of what was happening except me,\nand I didn't give a damn, really,\nbecause the whole world,\nand whole humanity,\nseemed as confused and lost as I was.\nI didn't give up then.\nI even tried to reconstruct\nmy identity on the social media\nlike everyone else does.\nI thought if I put on\nphilosophical tweets out there\npeople will think I'm with it,\nbut some of the responses I got\nfrom those tweets\nwere extremely confusing acronyms\nwhich I didn't understand. You know?\nROFL, LOL.\n\"Adidas,\" somebody wrote back\nto one of my more thought-provoking tweets\nand I was wondering\nwhy would you name a sneaker,\nI mean, why would you write back\nthe name of a sneaker to me?\nAnd I asked my 16-year-old daughter,\nand she enlightened me.\n\"Adidas\" now means\n\"All day I dream about sex.\"\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nReally.\nI didn't know if you know that.\nSo I wrote back,\n\"WTF\" in bold to Mr. Adidas,\nthanking secretly that some acronyms\nand things won't change at all.\nWTF.\n\n\n\n10:21\n\n\nBut here we are.\nI am 51 years old, like I told you,\nand mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,\nI just want to tell you\nif there has been a momentous time\nfor humanity to exist,\nit is now,\nbecause the present you is brave.\nThe present you is hopeful.\nThe present you\nis innovative and resourceful,\nand of course, the present you\nis annoyingly indefinable.\nAnd in this spell-binding,\nimperfect moment of existence,\nfeeling a little brave\njust before I came here,\nI decided to take\na good, hard look at my face.\nAnd I realized that I'm beginning\nto look more and more\nlike the wax statue of me\nat Madame Tussaud's.\n\n\n\n11:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:07\n\n\nYeah, and in that moment of realization,\nI asked the most central\nand pertinent question to humanity and me:\nDo I need to fix my face?\nReally. I'm an actor, like I told you,\na modern expression of human creativity.\nThe land I come from\nis the source of inexplicable\nbut very simple spirituality.\nIn its immense generosity,\nIndia decided somehow\nthat I, the Muslim son\nof a broke freedom fighter\nwho accidentally ventured\ninto the business of selling dreams,\nshould become its king of romance,\nthe \"Badhshah of Bollywood,\"\nthe greatest lover\nthe country has ever seen ...\nwith this face.\nYeah.\n\n\n\n12:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\nWhich has alternately\nbeen described as ugly, unconventional,\nand strangely, not chocolatey enough.\n\n\n\n12:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\nThe people of this ancient land\nembraced me in their limitless love,\nand I've learned from these people\nthat neither power nor poverty\ncan make your life more magical\nor less tortuous.\nI've learned from the people of my country\nthat the dignity of a life,\na human being, a culture,\na religion, a country\nactually resides in its ability\nfor grace and compassion.\nI've learned that whatever moves you,\nwhatever urges you to create, to build,\nwhatever keeps you from failing,\nwhatever helps you survive,\nis perhaps the oldest and the simplest\nemotion known to mankind,\nand that is love.\nA mystic poet from my land famously wrote,\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\n(Recites poem in Hindi)\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\n(Poem ends)\n\n\n\n13:13\n\n\nWhich loosely translates\ninto that whatever —\nyeah, if you know Hindi,\nplease clap, yeah.\n\n\n\n13:18\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:19\n\n\nIt's very difficult to remember.\nWhich loosely translates\ninto actually saying\nthat all the books of knowledge\nthat you might read\nand then go ahead\nand impart your knowledge\nthrough innovation,\nthrough creativity, through technology,\nbut mankind will never be\nthe wiser about its future\nunless it is coupled with a sense of love\nand compassion for their fellow beings.\nThe two and a half alphabets\nwhich form the word \"प्रेम,\"\nwhich means \"love,\"\nif you are able to understand that\nand practice it,\nthat itself is enough\nto enlighten mankind.\nSo I truly believe the future \"you\"\nhas to be a you that loves.\nOtherwise it will cease to flourish.\nIt will perish in its own self-absorption.\n\n\n\n14:09\n\n\nSo you may use your power\nto build walls\nand keep people outside,\nor you may use it to break barriers\nand welcome them in.\nYou may use your faith\nto make people afraid\nand terrify them into submission,\nor you can use it\nto give courage to people\nso they rise to the greatest\nheights of enlightenment.\nYou can use your energy\nto build nuclear bombs\nand spread the darkness of destruction,\nor you can use it to spread\nthe joy of light to millions.\nYou may filthy up the oceans callously\nand cut down all the forests.\nYou can destroy the ecology,\nor turn to them with love\nand regenerate life\nfrom the waters and trees.\nYou may land on Mars\nand build armed citadels,\nor you may look for life-forms and species\nto learn from and respect.\nAnd you can use\nall the moneys we all have earned\nto wage futile wars\nand give guns in the hands\nof little children\nto kill each other with,\nor you can use it\nto make more food\nto fill their stomachs with.\n\n\n\n15:25\n\n\nMy country has taught me\nthe capacity for a human being to love\nis akin to godliness.\nIt shines forth in a world\nwhich civilization, I think,\nalready has tampered too much with.\nIn the last few days,\nthe talks here, the wonderful people\ncoming and showing their talent,\ntalking about individual achievements,\nthe innovation, the technology,\nthe sciences, the knowledge\nwe are gaining by being here\nin the presence of TED Talks\nand all of you\nare reasons enough\nfor us to celebrate the future \"us.\"\nBut within that celebration\nthe quest to cultivate\nour capacity for love and compassion\nhas to assert itself,\nhas to assert itself,\njust as equally.\n\n\n\n16:14\n\n\nSo I believe the future \"you\"\nis an infinite you.\nIt's called a chakra\nin India, like a circle.\nIt ends where it begins from\nto complete itself.\nA you that perceives\ntime and space differently\nunderstands both\nyour unimaginable\nand fantastic importance\nand your complete unimportance\nin the larger context of the universe.\nA you that returns back\nto the original innocence of humanity,\nwhich loves from the purity of heart,\nwhich sees from the eyes of truth,\nwhich dreams from the clarity\nof an untampered mind.\n\n\n\n17:07\n\n\nThe future \"you\" has to be\nlike an aging movie star\nwho has been made to believe\nthat there is a possibility\nof a world which is completely,\nwholly, self-obsessively\nin love with itself.\nA world — really, it has to be a you\nto create a world\nwhich is its own best lover.\nThat I believe, ladies and gentlemen,\nshould be the future \"you.\"\n\n\n\n17:34\n\n\nThank you very much.\nShukriya.\n\n\n\n17:37\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:39\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n17:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:43\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n17:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nLet's say you despise\nWestern democracy.\nDemocracy, in all its trappings,\nfree elections, town halls,\nendless debates about\nthe proper role of government.\nToo messy,\ntoo unpredictable,\ntoo constraining for your taste.\nAnd the way these democracies\nband together and lecture everyone else\nabout individual rights and freedoms —\nit gets under your skin.\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\nSo what to do about it?\nYou can call out the hypocrisy\nand failures of Western democracies\nand explain how your way is better,\nbut that's never really worked for you.\nWhat if you could get the people\nwhose support is the very foundation\nof these democracies\nto start questioning the system?\nMake the idea occur in their own minds\nthat democracy and its institutions\nare failing them,\ntheir elite are corrupt puppet masters\nand the country they knew is in free fall.\nTo do that,\nyou'll need to infiltrate\nthe information spheres\nof these democracies.\nYou'll need to turn\ntheir most powerful asset —\nan open mind —\ninto their greatest vulnerability.\nYou'll need people to question the truth.\n\n\n\n 1:35\n\n\nNow, you'll be familiar of hacking\nand leaks that happened in 2016.\nOne was the Democratic\nNational Committee's networks,\nand the personal email\naccounts of its staff,\nlater released on WikiLeaks.\nAfter that, various online personas,\nlike a supposed Romanian cybercriminal\nwho didn't speak Romanian,\naggressively pushed news\nof these leaks to journalists.\nThe media took the bait.\nThey were consumed by how much\nthe DNC hated Bernie.\nAt the time, it was that narrative\nthat far outshined the news\nthat a group of Russian government\nsponsored hackers\nwho we called \"Advanced\nPersistent Threat 28,\"\nor \"APT28\" for short,\nwas carrying out\nthese operations against the US.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nAnd there was no shortage of evidence.\nThis group of Russian government hackers\nhadn't just appeared out of nowhere\nin 2016.\nWe had started tracking\nthis group back in 2014.\nAnd the tools that APT28 used\nto compromise its victims' networks\ndemonstrated a thoughtful,\nwell-resourced effort\nthat had taken place for now over a decade\nin Moscow's time zone\nfrom about 9 am to 6 pm.\nAPT28 loved to prey on the emails\nand contacts of journalists in Chechnya,\nthe Georgian government,\neastern European defense attachés —\nall targets with an undeniable interest\nto the Russian government.\n\n\n\n 3:02\n\n\nWe weren't the only ones onto this.\nGovernments, research teams\nacross the world,\nwere coming to similar conclusions\nand observing the same\ntypes of operations.\nBut what Russia was doing in 2016\nwent far beyond espionage.\nThe DNC hack was just one of many\nwhere stolen data was posted online\naccompanied by a sensational narrative,\nthen amplified in social media\nfor lightning-speed adoption by the media.\nThis didn't ring the alarm bells\nthat a nation-state was trying\nto interfere with the credibility\nof another's internal affairs.\n\n\n\n 3:44\n\n\nSo why, collectively,\ndid we not see this coming?\nWhy did it take months\nbefore Americans understood\nthat they were under a state-sponsored\ninformation attack?\nThe easy answer is politics.\nThe Obama Administration was caught\nin a perfect catch-22.\nBy raising the specter that the Russian\ngovernment was interfering\nin the US presidential campaign,\nthe Administration risked appearing\nto meddle in the campaign itself.\nBut the better answer, I think,\nis that the US and the West\nwere utterly unequipped\nto recognize and respond\nto a modern information operation,\ndespite the fact that the US\nhad wielded information\nwith devastating success\nin an era not so long ago.\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nLook, so while the US and the West\nspent the last 20 years\ncaught up in cybersecurity —\nwhat networks to harden,\nwhich infrastructure to deem critical,\nhow to set up armies of cyber warriors\nand cyber commands —\nRussia was thinking in far more\nconsequential terms.\nBefore the first iPhone\neven hit the shelf,\nthe Russian government understood\nthe risks and the opportunity\nthat technology provided\nand the inter-communication\nand instant communication it provided us.\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\nAs our realities are increasingly\nbased on the information\nthat we're consuming\nat the palm of our hand\nand from the news feeds\nthat we're scanning\nand the hashtags and stories\nthat we see trending,\nthe Russian government\nwas the first to recognize\nhow this evolution\nhad turned your mind into the most\nexploitable device on the planet.\nAnd your mind is particularly exploitable\nif you're accustomed\nto an unfettered flow of information,\nnow increasingly curated\nto your own tastes.\nThis panorama of information\nthat's so interesting to you\ngives a state, or anyone for that matter,\na perfect back door into your mind.\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nIt's this new brand of state-sponsored\ninformation operations\nthat can be that much more successful,\nmore insidious,\nand harder for the target audience —\nthat includes the media —\nto decipher and characterize.\nIf you can get a hashtag\ntrending on Twitter,\nor chum the waters with fake news\ndirected to audiences\nprimed to receive it,\nor drive journalists to dissect\nterabytes of email\nfor a cent of impropriety —\nall tactics used in Russian operations —\nthen you've got a shot at effectively\ncamouflaging your operations\nin the mind of your target.\nThis is what Russia's long called\n\"reflexive control.\"\nIt's the ability to use\ninformation on someone else\nso that they make a decision\non their own accord\nthat's favorable to you.\nThis is nation-state-grade image control\nand perception management,\nand it's conducted by any means,\nwith any tools, network-based\nor otherwise, that will achieve it.\n\n\n\n 7:00\n\n\nTake this for another example.\nIn early February 2014, a few weeks\nbefore Russia would invade Crimea,\na phone call is posted on YouTube.\nIn it, there's two US diplomats.\nThey sound like they're playing\nkingmaker in Ukraine,\nand worse, they curse the EU\nfor its lack of speed and leadership\nin resolving the crisis.\nThe media covers the phone call,\nand then the ensuing diplomatic backlash\nleaves Washington and Europe reeling.\nAnd it creates a fissured response\nand a feckless attitude\ntowards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.\nMission accomplished.\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\nSo while hacked phone calls\nand emails and networks\nkeep grabbing the headlines,\nthe real operations are the ones\nthat are influencing\nthe decisions you make\nand the opinions you hold,\nall in the service of a nation-state's\nstrategic interest.\nThis is power in the information age.\nAnd this information is all\nthat much more seductive,\nall that much easier to take\nat face value and pass on,\nwhen it's authentic.\nWho's not interested in the truth\nthat's presented in phone calls and emails\nthat were never intended\nfor public consumption?\nBut how meaningful is that truth\nif you don't know why\nit's being revealed to you?\n\n\n\n 8:26\n\n\nWe must recognize that this place\nwhere we're increasingly living,\nwhich we've quaintly termed \"cyberspace,\"\nisn't defined by ones and zeroes,\nbut by information\nand the people behind it.\nThis is far more than a network\nof computers and devices.\nThis is a network composed of minds\ninteracting with computers and devices.\n\n\n\n 8:49\n\n\nAnd for this network,\nthere's no encryption,\nthere's no firewall,\nno two-factor authentication,\nno password complex enough to protect you.\nWhat you have for defense\nis far stronger, it's more adaptable,\nit's always running the latest version.\nIt's the ability to think critically:\ncall out falsehood,\npress for the facts.\nAnd above all, you must have the courage\nto unflinchingly pursue the truth.\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'd like to start with a simple question:\nWhy do the poor make\nso many poor decisions?\nI know it's a harsh question,\nbut take a look at the data.\nThe poor borrow more, save less,\nsmoke more, exercise less, drink more\nand eat less healthfully.\nWhy?\n\n\n\n 0:35\n\n\nWell, the standard explanation\nwas once summed up by the British\nPrime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.\nAnd she called poverty\n\"a personality defect.\"\n\n\n\n 0:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:45\n\n\nA lack of character, basically.\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\nNow, I'm sure not many of you\nwould be so blunt.\nBut the idea that there's something\nwrong with the poor themselves\nis not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.\nSome of you may believe that the poor\nshould be held responsible\nfor their own mistakes.\nAnd others may argue that we should\nhelp them to make better decisions.\nBut the underlying assumption is the same:\nthere's something wrong with them.\nIf we could just change them,\nif we could just teach them\nhow to live their lives,\nif they would only listen.\nAnd to be honest,\nthis was what I thought for a long time.\nIt was only a few years ago\nthat I discovered\nthat everything I thought I knew\nabout poverty was wrong.\n\n\n\n 1:37\n\n\nIt all started when I accidentally\nstumbled upon a paper\nby a few American psychologists.\nThey had traveled 8,000 miles,\nall the way to India,\nfor a fascinating study.\nAnd it was an experiment\nwith sugarcane farmers.\nYou should know that these farmers\ncollect about 60 percent\nof their annual income all at once,\nright after the harvest.\nThis means that they're relatively\npoor one part of the year\nand rich the other.\nThe researchers asked them to do\nan IQ test before and after the harvest.\nWhat they subsequently discovered\ncompletely blew my mind.\nThe farmers scored much worse\non the test before the harvest.\nThe effects of living\nin poverty, it turns out,\ncorrespond to losing 14 points of IQ.\nNow, to give you an idea,\nthat's comparable\nto losing a night's sleep\nor the effects of alcoholism.\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nA few months later,\nI heard that Eldar Shafir,\na professor at Princeton University\nand one of the authors of this study,\nwas coming over to Holland, where I live.\nSo we met up in Amsterdam\nto talk about his revolutionary\nnew theory of poverty.\nAnd I can sum it up in just two words:\nscarcity mentality.\nIt turns out that people\nbehave differently\nwhen they perceive a thing to be scarce.\nAnd what that thing is\ndoesn't much matter —\nwhether it's not enough time,\nmoney or food.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nYou all know this feeling,\nwhen you've got too much to do,\nor when you've put off breaking for lunch\nand your blood sugar takes a dive.\nThis narrows your focus\nto your immediate lack —\nto the sandwich you've got to have now,\nthe meeting that's starting\nin five minutes\nor the bills that have\nto be paid tomorrow.\nSo the long-term perspective\ngoes out the window.\nYou could compare it to a new computer\nthat's running 10 heavy programs at once.\nIt gets slower and slower, making errors.\nEventually, it freezes —\nnot because it's a bad computer,\nbut because it has too much to do at once.\nThe poor have the same problem.\nThey're not making dumb decisions\nbecause they are dumb,\nbut because they're living in a context\nin which anyone would make dumb decisions.\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nSo suddenly I understood\nwhy so many of our anti-poverty\nprograms don't work.\nInvestments in education, for example,\nare often completely ineffective.\nPoverty is not a lack of knowledge.\nA recent analysis of 201 studies\non the effectiveness\nof money-management training\ncame to the conclusion\nthat it has almost no effect at all.\nNow, don't get me wrong —\nthis is not to say the poor\ndon't learn anything —\nthey can come out wiser for sure.\nBut it's not enough.\nOr as Professor Shafir told me,\n\"It's like teaching someone to swim\nand then throwing them in a stormy sea.\"\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\nI still remember sitting there,\nperplexed.\nAnd it struck me\nthat we could have figured\nthis all out decades ago.\nI mean, these psychologists didn't need\nany complicated brain scans;\nthey only had to measure the farmer's IQ,\nand IQ tests were invented\nmore than 100 years ago.\nActually, I realized I had read about\nthe psychology of poverty before.\nGeorge Orwell, one of the greatest\nwriters who ever lived,\nexperienced poverty\nfirsthand in the 1920s.\n\"The essence of poverty,\"\nhe wrote back then,\nis that it \"annihilates the future.\"\nAnd he marveled at, quote,\n\"How people take it for granted\nthey have the right to preach at you\nand pray over you\nas soon as your income falls\nbelow a certain level.\"\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nNow, those words are every bit\nas resonant today.\nThe big question is, of course:\nWhat can be done?\nModern economists have\na few solutions up their sleeves.\nWe could help the poor\nwith their paperwork\nor send them a text message\nto remind them to pay their bills.\nThis type of solution is hugely popular\nwith modern politicians,\nmostly because,\nwell, they cost next to nothing.\nThese solutions are, I think,\na symbol of this era\nin which we so often treat the symptoms,\nbut ignore the underlying cause.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nSo I wonder:\nWhy don't we just change the context\nin which the poor live?\nOr, going back to our computer analogy:\nWhy keep tinkering around\nwith the software\nwhen we can easily solve the problem\nby installing some extra memory instead?\nAt that point, Professor Shafir\nresponded with a blank look.\nAnd after a few seconds, he said,\n\"Oh, I get it.\nYou mean you want to just hand out\nmore money to the poor\nto eradicate poverty.\nUh, sure, that'd be great.\nBut I'm afraid that brand\nof left-wing politics\nyou've got in Amsterdam —\nit doesn't exist in the States.\"\n\n\n\n 6:37\n\n\nBut is this really\nan old-fashioned, leftist idea?\nI remembered reading about an old plan —\nsomething that has been proposed\nby some of history's leading thinkers.\nThe philosopher Thomas More\nfirst hinted at it in his book, \"Utopia,\"\nmore than 500 years ago.\nAnd its proponents have spanned\nthe spectrum from the left to the right,\nfrom the civil rights campaigner,\nMartin Luther King,\nto the economist Milton Friedman.\nAnd it's an incredibly simple idea:\nbasic income guarantee.\n\n\n\n 7:12\n\n\nWhat it is?\nWell, that's easy.\nIt's a monthly grant, enough to pay\nfor your basic needs:\nfood, shelter, education.\nIt's completely unconditional,\nso no one's going to tell you\nwhat you have to do for it,\nand no one's going to tell you\nwhat you have to do with it.\nThe basic income\nis not a favor, but a right.\nThere's absolutely no stigma attached.\nSo as I learned about the true\nnature of poverty,\nI couldn't stop wondering:\nIs this the idea\nwe've all been waiting for?\nCould it really be that simple?\nAnd in the three years that followed,\nI read everything I could find\nabout basic income.\nI researched the dozens of experiments\nthat have been conducted\nall over the globe,\nand it didn't take long before I stumbled\nupon a story of a town\nthat had done it —\nhad actually eradicated poverty.\nBut then ...\nnearly everyone forgot about it.\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nThis story starts in Dauphin, Canada.\nIn 1974, everybody in this small town\nwas guaranteed a basic income,\nensuring that no one fell\nbelow the poverty line.\nAt the start of the experiment,\nan army of researchers\ndescended on the town.\nFor four years, all went well.\nBut then a new government\nwas voted into power,\nand the new Canadian cabinet saw\nlittle point to the expensive experiment.\nSo when it became clear there was\nno money left to analyze the results,\nthe researchers decided to pack\ntheir files away in some 2,000 boxes.\nTwenty-five years went by,\nand then Evelyn Forget,\na Canadian professor,\nfound the records.\nFor three years, she subjected the data\nto all manner of statistical analysis,\nand no matter what she tried,\nthe results were the same every time:\nthe experiment had been\na resounding success.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nEvelyn Forget discovered\nthat the people in Dauphin\nhad not only become richer\nbut also smarter and healthier.\nThe school performance of kids\nimproved substantially.\nThe hospitalization rate decreased\nby as much as 8.5 percent.\nDomestic violence incidents were down,\nas were mental health complaints.\nAnd people didn't quit their jobs.\nThe only ones who worked a little less\nwere new mothers and students —\nwho stayed in school longer.\nSimilar results have since been found\nin countless other experiments\naround the globe,\nfrom the US to India.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nSo ...\nhere's what I've learned.\nWhen it comes to poverty,\nwe, the rich, should stop\npretending we know best.\nWe should stop sending shoes\nand teddy bears to the poor,\nto people we have never met.\nAnd we should get rid of the vast\nindustry of paternalistic bureaucrats\nwhen we could simply\nhand over their salaries\nto the poor they're supposed to help.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:07\n\n\nBecause, I mean, the great\nthing about money\nis that people can use it\nto buy things they need\ninstead of things that self-appointed\nexperts think they need.\nJust imagine how many brilliant scientists\nand entrepreneurs and writers,\nlike George Orwell,\nare now withering away in scarcity.\nImagine how much energy\nand talent we would unleash\nif we got rid of poverty once and for all.\nI believe that a basic income would work\nlike venture capital for the people.\nAnd we can't afford not to do it,\nbecause poverty is hugely expensive.\nJust look at the cost of child poverty\nin the US, for example.\nIt's estimated at 500 billion\ndollars each year,\nin terms of higher health care\nspending, higher dropout rates,\nand more crime.\nNow, this is an incredible waste\nof human potential.\n\n\n\n10:59\n\n\nBut let's talk about\nthe elephant in the room.\nHow could we ever afford\na basic income guarantee?\nWell, it's actually a lot cheaper\nthan you may think.\nWhat they did in Dauphin is finance it\nwith a negative income tax.\nThis means that your income is topped up\nas soon as you fall\nbelow the poverty line.\nAnd in that scenario,\naccording to our economists'\nbest estimates,\nfor a net cost of 175 billion —\na quarter of US military spending,\none percent of GDP —\nyou could lift all impoverished Americans\nabove the poverty line.\nYou could actually eradicate poverty.\nNow, that should be our goal.\n\n\n\n11:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:40\n\n\nThe time for small thoughts\nand little nudges is past.\nI really believe that the time has come\nfor radical new ideas,\nand basic income is so much more\nthan just another policy.\nIt is also a complete rethink\nof what work actually is.\nAnd in that sense,\nit will not only free the poor,\nbut also the rest of us.\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\nNowadays, millions of people feel\nthat their jobs have little\nmeaning or significance.\nA recent poll among 230,000 employees\nin 142 countries\nfound that only 13 percent of workers\nactually like their job.\nAnd another poll found that as much\nas 37 percent of British workers\nhave a job that they think\ndoesn't even need to exist.\nIt's like Brad Pitt says in \"Fight Club,\"\n\"Too often we're working jobs we hate\nso we can buy shit we don't need.\"\n\n\n\n12:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:32\n\n\nNow, don't get me wrong —\nI'm not talking about the teachers\nand the garbagemen\nand the care workers here.\nIf they stopped working,\nwe'd be in trouble.\nI'm talking about all those well-paid\nprofessionals with excellent résumés\nwho earn their money doing ...\nstrategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings\nwhile brainstorming the value\nadd-on of disruptive co-creation\nin the network society.\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:54\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:55\n\n\nOr something like that.\nJust imagine again how much\ntalent we're wasting,\nsimply because we tell our kids\nthey'll have to \"earn a living.\"\nOr think of what a math whiz working\nat Facebook lamented a few years ago:\n\"The best minds of my generation\nare thinking about how\nto make people click ads.\"\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nI'm a historian.\nAnd if history teaches us anything,\nit is that things could be different.\nThere is nothing inevitable\nabout the way we structured our society\nand economy right now.\nIdeas can and do change the world.\nAnd I think that especially\nin the past few years,\nit has become abundantly clear\nthat we cannot stick to the status quo —\nthat we need new ideas.\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\nI know that many of you\nmay feel pessimistic\nabout a future of rising inequality,\nxenophobia\nand climate change.\nBut it's not enough\nto know what we're against.\nWe also need to be for something.\nMartin Luther King didn't say,\n\"I have a nightmare.\"\n\n\n\n13:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:56\n\n\nHe had a dream.\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:58\n\n\nSo ...\nhere's my dream:\nI believe in a future\nwhere the value of your work\nis not determined\nby the size of your paycheck,\nbut by the amount of happiness you spread\nand the amount of meaning you give.\nI believe in a future\nwhere the point of education is not\nto prepare you for another useless job\nbut for a life well-lived.\nI believe in a future\nwhere an existence\nwithout poverty is not a privilege\nbut a right we all deserve.\nSo here we are.\nHere we are.\nWe've got the research,\nwe've got the evidence\nand we've got the means.\n\n\n\n14:32\n\n\nNow, more than 500 years after Thomas More\nfirst wrote about a basic income,\nand 100 years after George Orwell\ndiscovered the true nature of poverty,\nwe all need to change our worldview,\nbecause poverty\nis not a lack of character.\nPoverty is a lack of cash.\n\n\n\n14:50\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n14:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

in all seriousness,\nI was going through a lot\nof personal turmoil.\nFaced with enormous stress,\nI suffered an anxiety attack.\nOn some days, I could do no work.\nOn other days,\nI just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nMy doctor asked if I'd like to speak\nwith a mental health professional\nabout my stress and anxiety.\nMental health?\nI clammed up and violently\nshook my head in protest.\nI felt a profound sense of a shame.\nI felt the weight of stigma.\nI have a loving, supportive family\nand incredibly loyal friends,\nyet I could not entertain\nthe idea of speaking to anyone\nabout my feeling of pain.\nI felt suffocated\nby the rigid architecture\nof our African masculinity.\n\"People have real problems, Sangu.\nGet over yourself!\"\n\n\n\n 1:39\n\n\nThe first time I heard \"mental health,\"\nI was a boarding school student\nfresh off the boat from Ghana,\nat the Peddie School in New Jersey.\nI had just gone through\nthe brutal experience\nof losing seven loved ones\nin the same month.\nThe school nurse,\nconcerned about what I'd gone\nthrough — God bless her soul —\nshe inquired about my mental health.\n\"Is she mental?\" I thought.\nDoes she not know I'm an African man?\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\nLike Okonkwo in \"Things Fall Apart,\"\nwe African men neither process\nnor express our emotions.\nWe deal with our problems.\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:24\n\n\nWe deal with our problems.\nI called my brother and laughed\nabout \"Oyibo\" people — white people —\nand their strange diseases —\ndepression, ADD and those \"weird things.\"\nGrowing up in West Africa,\nwhen people used the term \"mental,\"\nwhat came to mind was a madman\nwith dirty, dread-locked hair,\nbumbling around half-naked on the streets.\nWe all know this man.\nOur parents warned us about him.\n\"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?\"\n\"Drugs!\nIf you even look at drugs,\nyou end up like him.\"\n\n\n\n 3:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:01\n\n\nCome down with pneumonia,\nand your mother will rush you\nto the nearest hospital\nfor medical treatment.\nBut dare to declare depression,\nand your local pastor\nwill be driving out demons\nand blaming witches in your village.\n\n\n\n 3:18\n\n\nAccording to the World\nHealth Organization,\nmental health is about being able to cope\nwith the normal stressors of life;\nto work productively and fruitfully;\nand to be able to make\na contribution to your community.\nMental health includes our emotional,\npsychological and social well-being.\nGlobally, 75 percent\nof all mental illness cases\ncan be found in low-income countries.\nYet most African governments\ninvest less than one percent\nof their health care budget\nin mental health.\n\n\n\n 3:57\n\n\nEven worse,\nwe have a severe shortage\nof psychiatrists in Africa.\nNigeria, for example,\nis estimated to have 200 —\nin a country of almost 200 million.\nIn all of Africa,\n90 percent of our people\nlack access to treatment.\nAs a result,\nwe suffer in solitude,\nsilenced by stigma.\n\n\n\n 4:28\n\n\nWe as Africans often respond\nto mental health with distance,\nignorance,\nguilt,\nfear\nand anger.\nIn a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez,\ndirectly asking, \"What is the cause\nof mental illness?\"\n34 percent of Nigerian respondents\ncited drug misuse;\n19 percent said divine wrath\nand the will of God —\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\n12 percent,\nwitchcraft and spiritual possession.\nBut few cited other known\ncauses of mental illness,\nlike genetics,\nsocioeconomic status,\nwar,\nconflict\nor the loss of a loved one.\nThe stigmatization against mental illness\noften results in the ostracizing\nand demonizing of sufferers.\nPhotojournalist Robin Hammond\nhas documented some of these abuses ...\nin Uganda,\nin Somalia,\nand here in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\nFor me,\nthe stigma is personal.\nIn 2009,\nI received a frantic call\nin the middle of the night.\nMy best friend in the world —\na brilliant, philosophical,\ncharming, hip young man —\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nI witnessed some of the friends\nwe'd grown up with recoil.\nI heard the snickers.\nI heard the whispers.\n\"Did you hear he has gone mad?\"\n(Kru English) \"He has gone crazy!\"\nDerogatory, demeaning commentary\nabout his condition —\nwords we would never say\nabout someone with cancer\nor someone with malaria.\nSomehow, when it comes to mental illness,\nour ignorance eviscerates all empathy.\nI stood by his side\nas his community isolated him,\nbut our love never wavered.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nTacitly, I became passionate\nabout mental health.\nInspired by his plight,\nI helped found the mental health\nspecial interest alumni group\nat my college.\nAnd during my tenure as a resident\ntutor in graduate school,\nI supported many undergraduates\nwith their mental health challenges.\nI saw African students struggle\nand unable to speak to anyone.\nEven with this knowledge\nand with their stories in tow,\nI, in turn, struggled,\nand could not speak to anyone\nwhen I faced my own anxiety,\nso deep is our fear of being the madman.\n\n\n\n 7:38\n\n\nAll of us —\nbut we Africans especially —\nneed to realize that our mental struggles\ndo not detract from our virility,\nnor does our trauma taint our strength.\nWe need to see mental health\nas important as physical health.\nWe need to stop suffering in silence.\nWe must stop stigmatizing disease\nand traumatizing the afflicted.\n\n\n\n 8:12\n\n\nTalk to your friends.\nTalk to your loved ones.\nTalk to health professionals.\nBe vulnerable.\nDo so with the confidence\nthat you are not alone.\nSpeak up if you're struggling.\nBeing honest about how we feel\ndoes not make us weak;\nit makes us human.\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nIt is time to end the stigma\nassociated with mental illness.\nSo the next time your hear \"mental,\"\ndo not just think of the madman.\nThink of me.\n\n\n\n 8:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI come to you today to speak of liars,\nlawsuits\nand laughter.\nThe first time I heard\nabout Holocaust denial,\nI laughed.\nHolocaust denial?\nThe Holocaust which has\nthe dubious distinction\nof being the best-documented\ngenocide in the world?\nWho could believe it didn't happen?\n\n\n\n 0:39\n\n\nThink about it.\nFor deniers to be right,\nwho would have to be wrong?\nWell, first of all, the victims —\nthe survivors who have told us\ntheir harrowing stories.\nWho else would have to be wrong?\nThe bystanders.\nThe people who lived in the myriads\nof towns and villages and cities\non the Eastern front,\nwho watched their neighbors\nbe rounded up —\nmen, women, children, young, old —\nand be marched\nto the outskirts of the town\nto be shot and left dead in ditches.\nOr the Poles,\nwho lived in towns and villages\naround the death camps,\nwho watched day after day\nas the trains went in filled with people\nand came out empty.\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\nBut above all, who would have to be wrong?\nThe perpetrators.\nThe people who say, \"We did it.\nI did it.\"\nNow, maybe they add a caveat.\nThey say, \"I didn't have a choice;\nI was forced to do it.\"\nBut nonetheless, they say, \"I did it.\"\nThink about it.\nIn not one war crimes trial\nsince the end of World War II\nhas a perpetrator of any nationality\never said, \"It didn't happen.\"\nAgain, they may have said, \"I was forced,\"\nbut never that it didn't happen.\nHaving thought that through,\nI decided denial was not\ngoing to be on my agenda;\nI had bigger things to worry about,\nto write about, to research,\nand I moved on.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nFast-forward a little over a decade,\nand two senior scholars —\ntwo of the most prominent historians\nof the Holocaust —\napproached me and said,\n\"Deborah, let's have coffee.\nWe have a research idea\nthat we think is perfect for you.\"\nIntrigued and flattered\nthat they came to me with an idea\nand thought me worthy of it,\nI asked, \"What is it?\"\nAnd they said, \"Holocaust denial.\"\nAnd for the second time, I laughed.\nHolocaust denial?\nThe Flat Earth folks?\nThe Elvis-is-alive people?\nI should study them?\nAnd these two guys said,\n\"Yeah, we're intrigued.\nWhat are they about?\nWhat's their objective?\nHow do they manage to get people\nto believe what they say?\"\n\n\n\n 3:13\n\n\nSo thinking, if they thought\nit was worthwhile,\nI would take a momentary diversion —\nmaybe a year, maybe two,\nthree, maybe even four —\nin academic terms, that's momentary.\n\n\n\n 3:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\nWe work very slowly.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\nAnd I would look at them.\nSo I did.\nI did my research, and I came up\nwith a number of things,\ntwo of which I'd like to share\nwith you today.\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\nOne:\ndeniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.\nThey are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis —\nyou can decide whether you want\nto put a \"neo\" there or not.\nBut when I looked at them,\nI didn't see any SS-like uniforms,\nswastika-like symbols on the wall,\nSieg Heil salutes —\nnone of that.\nWhat I found instead\nwere people parading\nas respectable academics.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\nWhat did they have?\nThey had an institute.\nAn \"Institute for Historical Review.\"\nThey had a journal — a slick journal —\na \"Journal of Historical Review.\"\nOne filled with papers —\nfootnote-laden papers.\nAnd they had a new name.\nNot neo-Nazis,\nnot anti-Semites —\nrevisionists.\nThey said, \"We are revisionists.\nWe are out to do one thing:\nto revise mistakes in history.\"\nBut all you had to do was go\none inch below the surface,\nand what did you find there?\nThe same adulation of Hitler,\npraise of the Third Reich,\nanti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.\nThis is what intrigued me.\nIt was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,\nparading as rational discourse.\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nThe other thing I found —\nmany of us have been taught to think\nthere are facts and there are opinions —\nafter studying deniers,\nI think differently.\nThere are facts,\nthere are opinions,\nand there are lies.\nAnd what deniers want to do\nis take their lies,\ndress them up as opinions —\nmaybe edgy opinions,\nmaybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions —\nbut then if they're opinions,\nthey should be part of the conversation.\nAnd then they encroach on the facts.\n\n\n\n 5:54\n\n\nI published my work —\nthe book was published,\n\"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing\nAssault on Truth and Memory,\"\nit came out in many different countries,\nincluding here in Penguin UK,\nand I was done with those folks\nand ready to move on.\nThen came the letter from Penguin UK.\nAnd for the third time, I laughed ...\nmistakenly.\nI opened the letter,\nand it informed me that David Irving\nwas bringing a libel suit against me\nin the United Kingdom\nfor calling him a Holocaust denier.\n\n\n\n 6:32\n\n\nDavid Irving suing me?\nWho was David Irving?\nDavid Irving was a writer\nof historical works,\nmost of them about World War II,\nand virtually all of those works\ntook the position\nthat the Nazis were really not so bad,\nand the Allies were really not so good.\nAnd the Jews, whatever happened to them,\nthey sort of deserved it.\nHe knew the documents,\nhe knew the facts,\nbut he somehow twisted them\nto get this opinion.\nHe hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,\nbut in the late '80s,\nhe embraced it with great vigor.\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nThe reason I laughed also\nwas this was a man\nwho not only was a Holocaust denier,\nbut seemed quite proud of it.\nHere was a man — and I quote —\nwho said, \"I'm going to sink\nthe battleship Auschwitz.\"\nHere was a man\nwho pointed to the number tattooed\non a survivor's arm and said,\n\"How much money have you made\nfrom having that number\ntattooed on your arm?\"\nHere was a man who said,\n\"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car\nat Chappaquiddick\nthan died in gas chambers at Auschwitz.\"\nThat's an American reference,\nbut you can look it up.\nThis was not a man who seemed\nat all ashamed or reticent\nabout being a Holocaust denier.\n\n\n\n 7:56\n\n\nNow, lots of my academic\ncolleagues counseled me —\n\"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it.\"\nWhen I explained you can't just\nignore a libel suit,\nthey said, \"Who's going to\nbelieve him anyway?\"\nBut here was the problem:\nBritish law put the onus,\nput the burden of proof on me\nto prove the truth of what I said,\nin contrast to as it would have\nbeen in the United States\nand in many other countries:\non him to prove the falsehood.\n\n\n\n 8:26\n\n\nWhat did that mean?\nThat meant if I didn't fight,\nhe would win by default.\nAnd if he won by default,\nhe could then legitimately say,\n\"My David Irving version of the Holocaust\nis a legitimate version.\nDeborah Lipstadt was found\nto have libeled me\nwhen she called me a Holocaust denier.\nIpso facto, I, David Irving,\nam not a Holocaust denier.\"\nAnd what is that version?\nThere was no plan to murder the Jews,\nthere were no gas chambers,\nthere were no mass shootings,\nHitler had nothing to do\nwith any suffering that went on,\nand the Jews have made this all up\nto get money from Germany\nand to get a state,\nand they've done it with the aid\nand abettance of the Allies —\nthey've planted the documents\nand planted the evidence.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nI couldn't let that stand\nand ever face a survivor\nor a child of survivors.\nI couldn't let that stand\nand consider myself\na responsible historian.\nSo we fought.\nAnd for those of you\nwho haven't seen \"Denial,\"\nspoiler alert:\nwe won.\n\n\n\n 9:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:50\n\n\nThe judge found David Irving\nto be a liar,\na racist,\nan anti-Semite.\nHis view of history was tendentious,\nhe lied, he distorted —\nand most importantly,\nhe did it deliberately.\nWe showed a pattern,\nin over 25 different major instances.\nNot small things — many of us\nin this audience write books,\nare writing books;\nwe always make mistakes, that's why\nwe're glad to have second editions:\ncorrect the mistakes.\n\n\n\n10:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:25\n\n\nBut these always moved\nin the same direction:\nblame the Jews,\nexonerate the Nazis.\n\n\n\n10:34\n\n\nBut how did we win?\nWhat we did is follow his footnotes\nback to his sources.\nAnd what did we find?\nNot in most cases,\nand not in the preponderance of cases,\nbut in every single instance where\nhe made some reference to the Holocaust,\nthat his supposed evidence was distorted,\nhalf-truth,\ndate-changed,\nsequence-changed,\nsomeone put at a meeting who wasn't there.\nIn other words,\nhe didn't have the evidence.\nHis evidence didn't prove it.\nWe didn't prove what happened.\nWe proved that what he said happened —\nand by extension, all deniers,\nbecause he either quotes them\nor they get their arguments from him —\nis not true.\nWhat they claim —\nthey don't have the evidence to prove it.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nSo why is my story\nmore than just the story\nof a quirky, long,\nsix-year, difficult lawsuit,\nan American professor\nbeing dragged into a courtroom\nby a man that the court\ndeclared in its judgment\nwas a neo-Nazi polemicist?\nWhat message does it have?\nI think in the context\nof the question of truth,\nit has a very significant message.\nBecause today,\nas we well know,\ntruth and facts are under assault.\nSocial media, for all\nthe gifts it has given us,\nhas also allowed the difference\nbetween facts — established facts —\nand lies\nto be flattened.\n\n\n\n12:15\n\n\nThird of all:\nextremism.\nYou may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,\nyou may not see burning crosses,\nyou may not even hear outright\nwhite supremacist language.\nIt may go by names: \"alt-right,\"\n\"National Front\" — pick your names.\nBut underneath, it's that same extremism\nthat I found in Holocaust denial\nparading as rational discourse.\n\n\n\n12:46\n\n\nWe live in an age\nwhere truth is on the defensive.\nI'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.\nA quiz show recently appeared\nin \"The New Yorker\"\nwhere the host of the quiz show\nis saying to one of the contestants,\n\"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.\nBut your opponent yelled\nmore loudly than you did,\nso he gets the point.\"\n\n\n\n13:07\n\n\nWhat can we do?\nFirst of all,\nwe cannot be beguiled\nby rational appearances.\nWe've got to look underneath,\nand we will find there the extremism.\nSecond of all,\nwe must understand\nthat truth is not relative.\nNumber three,\nwe must go on the offensive,\nnot the defensive.\nWhen someone makes an outrageous claim,\neven though they may hold\none of the highest offices in the land,\nif not the world —\nwe must say to them,\n\"Where's the proof?\nWhere's the evidence?\"\nWe must hold their feet to the fire.\nWe must not treat it as if their lies\nare the same as the facts.\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\nAnd as I said earlier,\ntruth is not relative.\nMany of us have grown up\nin the world of the academy\nand enlightened liberal thought,\nwhere we're taught\neverything is open to debate.\nBut that's not the case.\nThere are certain things that are true.\nThere are indisputable facts —\nobjective truths.\nGalileo taught it to us centuries ago.\nEven after being forced\nto recant by the Vatican\nthat the Earth moved around the Sun,\nhe came out,\nand what is he reported to have said?\n\"And yet, it still moves.\"\n\n\n\n14:46\n\n\nThe Earth is not flat.\nThe climate is changing.\nElvis is not alive.\n\n\n\n14:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n14:58\n\n\nAnd most importantly,\ntruth and fact are under assault.\nThe job ahead of us,\nthe task ahead of us,\nthe challenge ahead of us\nis great.\nThe time to fight is short.\nWe must act now.\nLater will be too late.\n\n\n\n15:23\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n15:24\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'm going to tell you the story of a song.\nI was in Madrid one night in 2002\nwith my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,\nwhen he said he had something to give me.\nHe said,\n\"Jorge, I have some lines\nthat you need to put into a song.\nTake these down, take these down.\"\nI looked on the table but all I found\nwas a circular coaster,\non which I wrote the lines\nmy teacher dictated.\nThey were four lines that went like this:\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n\"I am a Jewish Moor\nliving among Christians\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\"\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nThose lines really made\nan impression on me.\nI said, \"What beautiful lyrics,\nJoaquín. Did you write them?\"\nHe said no, they were by another composer\nnamed Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,\nwho was less known than Joaquín,\nbut also a great poet.\nThese lines came to me at a time\nwhere I had been wanting\nto express something for a while,\nbut didn't quite know how.\n\n\n\n 1:08\n\n\nI was getting up to leave\nand go home to write,\nwhen Joaquín stopped me\nand said, \"Hang on, hang on,\"\nand presented me with this challenge:\n\"Write the stanzas for this song\nin Décimas.\"\nNow, at this point in my life,\nI still wasn't completely\nsure what Décimas were,\nbut I was too embarrassed\nto tell my teacher I didn't know.\nSo I put on my best\n\"Yeah, I totally understand\" face,\nand went home to look up\nwhat Décimas were.\nI learned that a Décima is a type of verse\nthat only exists in Spanish,\nand that it has 10 lines.\nIt's very, very complex —\nperhaps the most complex style of stanza\nthat we have in Spanish.\nIt also has a very concrete\ndate of origin,\nwhich is very rare for a style of stanza.\n\n\n\n 1:55\n\n\nThe Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,\nby a guy named Vicente Espinel,\na musician and poet from Málaga.\nAnd listen to this coincidence:\nhe was the same guy\nwho added the sixth string\nto what would later be called\nthe Spanish guitar.\nThis string right here —\nit's called the \"bordona.\"\n\n\n\n 2:17\n\n\nFrom Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,\ncrosses over to America,\njust like the Spanish guitar,\nbut in contrast to the Décima,\nthe Spanish guitar continues to live today\non both sides of the Atlantic.\nBut the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,\ndisappeared; it died out.\nIt died out about 200 years ago,\nand yet in Latin America,\nfrom Mexico to Chile,\nall our countries maintain\nsome form of the Décima\nin our popular traditions.\n\n\n\n 2:51\n\n\nIn each place, they've given it\na different name,\nand set it to different music.\nIt has a lot of different names —\nmore than 20 in total on the continent.\nIn Mexico, for example,\nit's called the \"Son Jarocho,\"\n\"Canto de mejorana\" in Panama;\n\"Galerón\" in Venezuela;\n\"Payada\" in Uruguay and Argentina;\n\"Repentismo\" in Cuba.\nIn Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,\nbecause the Décima becomes\nso integrated into our traditions,\nthat if someone asks, people\nfrom each place are completely convinced\nthat the Décima was invented\nin their country.\n\n\n\n 3:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:24\n\n\nIt's also got a really surprising feature,\nwhich is that despite the fact\nthat it developed independently\nin each of the different countries,\nit maintains even today,\n400 years after its creation,\nexactly the same rhyme,\nsyllable and line structure —\nthe same structure Vicente Espinel gave it\nduring the Spanish Baroque period.\nHere's the structure —\nI'll give you the basic idea\nand then later you can look online\nand learn more about it.\n\n\n\n 3:54\n\n\nThe Décima is ten lines long;\neach line has eight syllables.\nThe first line rhymes\nwith the fourth and the fifth;\nthe second line, with the third;\nthe sixth line,\nwith the seventh and the tenth;\nand the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.\nIt's a bit complicated, to be honest.\nAnd me — imagine me,\ntrying to write in Décimas.\nBut it's not as complicated as it seems.\nPlus, it's amazing that it's survived\nwith the same structure\nfor more than four centuries.\nIt's not that complicated, because it has\nan impressive musicality to it,\na type of musicality\nthat's very hard to describe technically.\nI prefer that you listen to it.\nSo I'm going to recite a Décima,\none of the Décimas\nthat I wrote for this song.\nI'm going to ask that you concentrate\njust on the musicality of the rhymes.\nFor those of you with headphones on —\nI see that some of you are listening\nto the translation —\nplease take them off for a minute.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\n(English) Take your headphones off,\nit you have them.\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\n(English) Forget about the meaning\nof the words for a few seconds,\n\n\n\n 5:08\n\n\n(English) and then you'll put them back.\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\n(English) Forget about the structure.\n\n\n\n 5:12\n\n\n(Spanish) Forget about the structure.\n\n\n\n 5:14\n\n\n(English) And just ... it's all about\nthe choreography of sound of the Décima.\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\n(Spanish) A choreography of sound.\n\n\n\n 5:23\n\n\n(Sings in Spanish) \"There is not one death\nthat does not cause me pain,\nthere are no winners,\nhere’s nothing but suffering\nand another life blown away.\nWar is a terrible school\nno matter what the disguise,\nforgive me for not enlisting\nunder any flag,\nany daydream is worth more\nthan a sad piece of cloth.\"\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\nThat's a Décima.\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\n(English) You can put\nyour headphones back on.\n\n\n\n 5:49\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\n(English) Thank you.\n\n\n\n 5:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nI also applaud Vicente Espinel,\nbecause here it is 426 years later,\nand the Décima lives on everywhere\nin its original state.\n\n\n\n 6:02\n\n\nI wrote three like that one;\nyou just heard the second.\nI wrote the first one having only\nrecently learned how,\nand it has some errors in terms of meter,\nso it's not presentable\nin its current state.\nBut the one I sang was good, more or less.\nSo: What was it about?\nWhat was the meaning behind those lines?\n\n\n\n 6:20\n\n\nI had just returned from doing\na concert in Israel,\nand I was very emotional over a problem\nthat hits really close to home,\nwhich is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nI'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,\nand my mom's family\nare non-practicing Christians.\nI was raised in a home\nwhere the two traditions lived together\nmore or less in harmony.\nIt wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa\ndressed as Santa Claus, for example,\nor to see my non-Jewish grandpa\nat the synagogue wearing his kippah,\nat family celebrations, wearing the same\nexpression that I probably had\nwhen Sabina told me —\n\n\n\n 6:55\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nthat he had some Décima lines for me.\nFor someone raised\nin that kind of environment,\nit's especially painful to see\nthe difficulty the opposing parties have\nin putting themselves in the other\nside's shoes even for a moment.\nSo that's what I wrote about.\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\nI already had the lyrics,\nI had the form — the Décima —\nand the content.\nI needed to write the music.\nI'll give you some context.\nI had only recently moved from Uruguay,\nwhere I'm from, to Spain.\nAnd I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,\nlike many of you here,\nwho are away from home.\nAnd I wanted my song\nto be very, very Uruguayan,\nthe most Uruguayan type of song\nthere is — the milonga.\nSo now, I had been studying the Décima,\nand after finding out\nthat everyone tried to claim\nthe Décima as their own,\nthat it was invented in their country,\nit made me wonder:\nWhat does it mean when we say\nthe milonga is Uruguayan?\n\n\n\n 7:57\n\n\nThe milonga has a rhythmic pattern\nthat we musicians call 3-3-2.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\n(Counts out the beats) One two three,\none two three, one two.\n\n\n\n 8:10\n\n\nAnd it has a characteristic emphasis.\n\n\n\n 8:13\n\n\n(Sings)\n\n\n\n 8:21\n\n\nBut this characteristic rhythm pattern\ncomes from Africa.\nIn the ninth century you could find it\nin the brothels of Persia,\nand in the thirteenth,\nin Spain, from where,\nfive centuries later,\nit would cross over to America\nwith the African slaves.\nMeanwhile, in the Balkans,\nit encounters the Roma scale —\n\n\n\n 8:43\n\n\n(Sings)\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\nwhich in part, gives birth\nto klezmer music,\nwhich Ukrainian Jewish immigrants\nbring to Brooklyn, New York.\nThey sing it in their banquet halls.\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\n(Sings \"Hava Nagila\")\n\n\n\n 9:08\n\n\nAnd their neighbor,\nan Argentine kid of Italian origin\nnamed Astor Piazzolla,\nhears it,\nassimilates it\nand transforms the tango\nof the second half of the 20th century\nwith his ...\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\n(Counts out the beats) One two three,\none two three, one two.\n\n\n\n 9:25\n\n\n(Sings \"Adios Nonino\")\n\n\n\n 9:33\n\n\nHe also played it on his bandoneon,\na 19th-century German instrument\ncreated for churches\nthat weren't allowed to buy organs,\nand that ends up, incredibly,\nin Río de la Plata,\nforming the very essence\nof the tango and the milonga,\nin the very same way another instrument\njust as important as the bandoneon did:\nthe Spanish guitar.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:07\n\n\nTo which, by the way,\nVicente Espinel, in the 16th century,\nadded a sixth string.\nIt's amazing how all these things\nare coming full circle.\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\nWhat have I learned in these 15 years\nsince the song was born\nfrom going all over the world\nwith four lines written on a coaster\nfrom a bar in Madrid?\nThat Décimas,\nthe milonga,\nsongs, people —\nthe closer you get to them,\nthe more complex their identity becomes,\nand the more nuances and details appear.\nI learned that identity\nis infinitely dense,\nlike an infinite series of real numbers,\nand that even if you get very close\nand zoom in,\nit never ends.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\n\nBefore I sing you a song and say goodbye,\nallow me to tell you one last story.\nNot long ago, we were in Mexico\nafter a concert.\nAnd since the concert promoters know me,\nthey knew I was a Décima freak\nand that everywhere I go I ask about it,\ninsisting on hearing Décima artists.\nSo they organized a son jarocho show\nfor me at their house.\nIf you recall, the son jarocho\nis one of the styles of music\nthat uses Décimas in its verses.\n\n\n\n11:23\n\n\nWhen these amazing musicians\nfinished playing\nwhat is for me, something amazing,\nwhich is the son jarocho,\nthey finished playing and were ...\nI went up to greet them, really excited,\ngetting ready to thank them\nfor their gift of music,\nand this young kid says to me —\nand he says it with the best\nof intentions — he says,\n\"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping\nalive the purest origins\nof our Mexican identity.\"\nAnd to tell you the truth,\nI didn't really know what to say.\n\n\n\n11:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:59\n\n\nI stood there looking at him.\nI gave him a hug and left, but ...\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:03\n\n\nBut he was right, too, though. Right?\nIn reality, the Décima is its origin,\nbut at the same time,\njust like in the milonga\nand in the Décima,\nare the roots of many more cultures\nfrom all over the place, like he said.\n\n\n\n12:17\n\n\nLater, when I got back to the hotel,\nI thought about it for a while.\nAnd I thought:\nthings only look pure\nif you look at them from far away.\nIt's very important\nto know about our roots,\nto know where we come from,\nto understand our history.\nBut at the same time, as important\nas knowing where we're from,\nis understanding that deep down,\nwe're all from nowhere\nand a little bit from everywhere.\n\n\n\n12:46\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:57\n\n\nThis is \"The milonga of the Jewish Moor.\"\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n13:13\n\n\n(Sings)\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nFor every wall a lament\nin Jerusalem the golden\n\n\n\n13:23\n\n\nand 100 wasted lives\nfor every commandment.\n\n\n\n13:30\n\n\nI am dust in your wind\nand although I bleed through your wound,\n\n\n\n13:38\n\n\nand every beloved stone\nhas my deepest affection,\n\n\n\n13:44\n\n\nthere is not a stone in the world\nworth more than a human life.\n\n\n\n13:53\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n14:00\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n14:09\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n14:18\n\n\nThere is not one death that does not\ncause me pain, there are no winners\n\n\n\n14:26\n\n\nthere's nothing but suffering\nand another life blown away.\n\n\n\n14:33\n\n\nWar is a terrible school\nno matter what the disguise,\n\n\n\n14:40\n\n\nforgive me for not enlisting\nunder any flag,\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\nany daydream is worth more\nthan a sad piece of cloth.\n\n\n\n14:56\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n15:03\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n15:11\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n15:24\n\n\nAnd nobody has my permission\nfor killing in my name,\n\n\n\n15:32\n\n\na man is but a man\nand if there is a God, this was his wish,\n\n\n\n15:39\n\n\nthe very ground I tread\nwill live on, once I am gone\n\n\n\n15:46\n\n\non my way to oblivion, and all doctrines\nwill suffer the same fate,\n\n\n\n15:53\n\n\nand there is not one nation\nthat has not proclaimed itself\n\n\n\n15:58\n\n\nthe chosen people.\n\n\n\n16:02\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n16:09\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n16:18\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n16:23\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n16:31\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n16:32\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:33\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nGetting a college education\nis a 20-year investment.\nWhen you're growing up poor,\nyou're not accustomed\nto thinking that far ahead.\nInstead, you're thinking about\nwhere you're going to get your next meal\nand how your family\nis going to pay rent that month.\nBesides, my parents\nand my friends' parents\nseemed to be doing just fine\ndriving taxis and working as janitors.\nIt wasn't until I was a teenager\nwhen I realized I didn't\nwant to do those things.\nBy then, I was two-thirds of the way\nthrough my education,\nand it was almost too late\nto turn things around.\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\nWhen you grow up poor,\nyou want to be rich.\nI was no different.\nI'm the second-oldest of seven,\nand was raised by a single mother\non government aid\nin Queens, New York.\nBy virtue of growing up low-income,\nmy siblings and I went\nto some of New York City's\nmost struggling public schools.\nI had over 60 absences\nwhen I was in seventh grade,\nbecause I didn't feel like going to class.\nMy high school had\na 55 percent graduation rate,\nand even worse,\nonly 20 percent of the kids graduating\nwere college-ready.\n\n\n\n 1:21\n\n\nWhen I actually did make it to college,\nI told my friend Brennan\nhow our teachers would always ask us\nto raise our hands\nif we were going to college.\nI was taken aback when Brennan said,\n\"Karim, I've never been asked\nthat question before.\"\nIt was always, \"What college\nare you going to?\"\nJust the way that question is phrased\nmade it unacceptable for him\nnot to have gone to college.\n\n\n\n 1:46\n\n\nNowadays I get asked a different question.\n\"How were you able to make it out?\"\nFor years I said I was lucky,\nbut it's not just luck.\nWhen my older brother and I\ngraduated from high school\nat the very same time\nand he later dropped out\nof a two-year college,\nI wanted to understand why he dropped out\nand I kept studying.\nIt wasn't until I got to Cornell\nas a Presidential Research Scholar\nthat I started to learn about\nthe very real educational consequences\nof being raised by a single mother\non government aid\nand attending the schools that I did.\nThat's when my older brother's trajectory\nbegan to make complete sense to me.\n\n\n\n 2:27\n\n\nI also learned that our most admirable\neducation reformers,\npeople like Arne Duncan,\nthe former US Secretary of Education,\nor Wendy Kopp, the founder\nof Teach For America,\nhad never attended an inner city\npublic school like I had.\nSo much of our education reform\nis driven by a sympathetic approach,\nwhere people are saying,\n\"Let's go and help\nthese poor inner city kids,\nor these poor black and Latino kids,\"\ninstead of an empathetic approach,\nwhere someone like me, who had grown up\nin this environment, could say,\n\"I know the adversities that you're facing\nand I want to help you overcome them.\"\n\n\n\n 3:02\n\n\nToday when I get questions\nabout how I made it out,\nI share that one of the biggest reasons\nis that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.\nIn a typical middle class\nor affluent household,\nif a kid is struggling,\nthere's a good chance that a parent\nor a teacher will come to their rescue\neven if they don't ask for help.\nHowever, if that same kid\nis growing up poor\nand doesn't ask for help,\nthere's a good chance\nthat no one will help them.\nThere are virtually\nno social safety nets available.\n\n\n\n 3:32\n\n\nSo seven years ago,\nI started to reform\nour public education system\nshaped by my firsthand perspective.\nAnd I started with summer school.\nResearch tells us that two-thirds\nof the achievement gap,\nwhich is the disparity\nin educational attainment\nbetween rich kids and poor kids\nor black kids and white kids,\ncould be directly attributed\nto the summer learning loss.\nIn low-income neighborhoods,\nkids forget almost three months\nof what they learned\nduring the school year\nover the summer.\nThey return to school in the fall,\nand their teachers\nspend another two months\nreteaching them old material.\nThat's five months.\nThe school year in the United States\nis only 10 months.\nIf kids lose five months of learning\nevery single year,\nthat's half of their education.\nHalf.\n\n\n\n 4:19\n\n\nIf kids were in school over the summer,\nthen they couldn't regress,\nbut traditional summer school\nis poorly designed.\nFor kids it feels like punishment,\nand for teachers\nit feels like babysitting.\nBut how can we expect principals\nto execute an effective summer program\nwhen the school year\nends the last week of June\nand then summer school starts\njust one week later?\nThere just isn't enough time\nto find the right people,\nsort out the logistics,\nand design an engaging curriculum\nthat excites kids and teachers.\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\nBut what if we created a program\nover the summer\nthat empowered teachers\nas teaching coaches\nto develop aspiring educators?\nWhat if we empowered\ncollege-educated role models\nas teaching fellows\nto help kids realize\ntheir college ambitions?\nWhat if empowered high-achieving kids\nas mentors to tutor their younger peers\nand inspire them\nto invest in their education?\nWhat if we empowered all kids as scholars,\nasked them what colleges\nthey were going to,\ndesigned a summer school\nthey want to attend\nto completely eliminate\nthe summer learning loss\nand close two-thirds\nof the achievement gap?\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\nBy this summer, my team will have served\nover 4,000 low-income children,\ntrained over 300 aspiring teachers\nand created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs\nacross some of New York City's\nmost disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nAnd our kids are succeeding.\nTwo years of independent evaluations\ntell us that our kids\neliminate the summer learning loss\nand make growth of one month in math\nand two months in reading.\nSo instead of returning to school\nin the fall three months behind,\nthey now go back four months ahead in math\nand five months ahead in reading.\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:23\n\n\nTen years ago, if you would have told me\nthat I'd graduate in the top 10 percent\nof my class from an Ivy League institution\nand have an opportunity to make a dent\non our public education system\njust by tackling two months\nof the calendar year,\nI would have said,\n\"Nah. No way.\"\nWhat's even more exciting\nis that if we can prevent\nfive months of lost time\njust by redesigning two months,\nimagine the possibilities\nthat we can unlock\nby tackling the rest of the calendar year.\n\n\n\n 6:57\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 6:58\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nIn 1956, a documentary\nby Jacques Cousteau won\nboth the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.\nThis film was called,\n\"Le Monde Du Silence,\"\nor, \"The Silent World.\"\nThe premise of the title was that\nthe underwater world was a quiet world.\nWe now know, 60 years later,\nthat the underwater world\nis anything but silent.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nAlthough the sounds\nare inaudible above water\ndepending on where you are\nand the time of year,\nthe underwater soundscape can be as noisy\nas any jungle or rainforest.\nInvertebrates like snapping shrimp,\nfish and marine mammals\nall use sound.\nThey use sound to study their habitat,\nto keep in communication with each other,\nto navigate,\nto detect predators and prey.\nThey also use sound by listening\nto know something about their environment.\n\n\n\n 1:12\n\n\nTake, for an example, the Arctic.\nIt's considered a vast,\ninhospitable place,\nsometimes described as a desert,\nbecause it is so cold and so remote\nand ice-covered for much of the year.\nAnd despite this,\nthere is no place on Earth\nthat I would rather be than the Arctic,\nespecially as days lengthen\nand spring comes.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nTo me, the Arctic really\nembodies this disconnect\nbetween what we see on the surface\nand what's going on underwater.\nYou can look out across the ice —\nall white and blue and cold —\nand see nothing.\nBut if you could hear underwater,\nthe sounds you would hear\nwould at first amaze\nand then delight you.\nAnd while your eyes are seeing\nnothing for kilometers but ice,\nyour ears are telling you that out there\nare bowhead and beluga whales,\nwalrus and bearded seals.\nThe ice, too, makes sounds.\nIt screeches and cracks\nand pops and groans,\nas it collides and rubs when temperature\nor currents or winds change.\nAnd under 100 percent sea ice\nin the dead of winter,\nbowhead whales are singing.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nAnd you would never expect that,\nbecause we humans,\nwe tend to be very visual animals.\nFor most of us, but not all,\nour sense of sight is how\nwe navigate our world.\nFor marine mammals that live underwater,\nwhere chemical cues\nand light transmit poorly,\nsound is the sense by which they see.\nAnd sound transmits very well underwater,\nmuch better than it does in air,\nso signals can be heard\nover great distances.\n\n\n\n 3:07\n\n\nIn the Arctic, this\nis especially important,\nbecause not only do Arctic marine\nmammals have to hear each other,\nbut they also have to listen\nfor cues in the environment\nthat might indicate\nheavy ice ahead or open water.\nRemember, although they spend\nmost of their lives underwater,\nthey are mammals,\nand so they have to surface to breathe.\nSo they might listen\nfor thin ice or no ice,\nor listen for echoes off nearby ice.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nArctic marine mammals live in a rich\nand varied underwater soundscape.\nIn the spring,\nit can be a cacophony of sound.\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\n(Marine mammal sounds)\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\nBut when the ice is frozen solid,\nand there are no big temperature\nshifts or current changes,\nthe underwater Arctic has some\nof the lowest ambient noise levels\nof the world's oceans.\nBut this is changing.\nThis is primarily due to a decrease\nin seasonal sea ice,\nwhich is a direct result of human\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nWe are, in effect, with climate change,\nconducting a completely uncontrolled\nexperiment with our planet.\n\n\n\n 4:34\n\n\nOver the past 30 years,\nareas of the Arctic have seen\ndecreases in seasonal sea ice\nfrom anywhere from\nsix weeks to four months.\nThis decrease in sea ice is sometimes\nreferred to as an increase\nin the open water season.\nThat is the time of year when\nthe Arctic is navigable to vessels.\nAnd not only is the extent\nof ice changing,\nbut the age and the width of ice is, too.\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\nNow, you may well have heard\nthat a decrease in seasonal sea ice\nis causing a loss of habitat\nfor animals that rely on sea ice,\nsuch as ice seals,\nor walrus, or polar bears.\nDecreasing sea ice is also causing\nincreased erosion along coastal villages,\nand changing prey availability\nfor marine birds and mammals.\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nClimate change and decreases in sea ice\nare also altering the underwater\nsoundscape of the Arctic.\nWhat do I mean by soundscape?\nThose of us who eavesdrop\non the oceans for a living\nuse instruments called hydrophones,\nwhich are underwater microphones,\nand we record ambient noise —\nthe noise all around us.\nAnd the soundscape describes\nthe different contributors\nto this noise field.\nWhat we are hearing on our hydrophones\nare the very real sounds\nof climate change.\nWe are hearing these changes\nfrom three fronts:\nfrom the air,\nfrom the water\nand from land.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nFirst: air.\nWind on water creates waves.\nThese waves make bubbles;\nthe bubbles break,\nand when they do,\nthey make noise.\nAnd this noise is like a hiss\nor a static in the background.\nIn the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,\nmost of the noise from wind\ndoesn't make it into the water column,\nbecause the ice acts as a buffer\nbetween the atmosphere and the water.\nThis is one of the reasons\nthat the Arctic can have\nvery low ambient noise levels.\nBut with decreases in seasonal sea ice,\nnot only is the Arctic now open\nto this wave noise,\nbut the number of storms\nand the intensity of storms in the Arctic\nhas been increasing.\nAll of this is raising noise levels\nin a previously quiet ocean.\n\n\n\n 7:01\n\n\nSecond: water.\nWith less seasonal sea ice,\nsubarctic species are moving north,\nand taking advantage of the new habitat\nthat is created by more open water.\nNow, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,\nthey have no dorsal fin,\nbecause they have evolved to live\nand swim in ice-covered waters,\nand having something sticking\noff of your back is not very conducive\nto migrating through ice,\nand may, in fact, be excluding\nanimals from the ice.\nBut now, everywhere we've listened,\nwe're hearing the sounds\nof fin whales and humpback whales\nand killer whales,\nfurther and further north,\nand later and later in the season.\nWe are hearing, in essence,\nan invasion of the Arctic\nby subarctic species.\nAnd we don't know what this means.\nWill there be competition for food\nbetween Arctic and subarctic animals?\nMight these subarctic species introduce\ndiseases or parasites into the Arctic?\nAnd what are the new sounds\nthat they are producing\ndoing to the soundscape underwater?\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nAnd third: land.\nAnd by land ...\nI mean people.\nMore open water means\nincreased human use of the Arctic.\nJust this past summer,\na massive cruise ship made its way\nthrough the Northwest Passage —\nthe once-mythical route\nbetween Europe and the Pacific.\nDecreases in sea ice have allowed\nhumans to occupy the Arctic more often.\nIt has allowed increases in oil\nand gas exploration and extraction,\nthe potential for commercial shipping,\nas well as increased tourism.\nAnd we now know that ship noise increases\nlevels of stress hormones in whales\nand can disrupt feeding behavior.\nAir guns, which produce loud,\nlow-frequency \"whoomps\"\nevery 10 to 20 seconds,\nchanged the swimming and vocal\nbehavior of whales.\nAnd all of these sound sources\nare decreasing the acoustic space\nover which Arctic marine mammals\ncan communicate.\n\n\n\n 9:17\n\n\nNow, Arctic marine mammals\nare used to very high levels of noise\nat certain times of the year.\nBut this is primarily from other\nanimals or from sea ice,\nand these are the sounds\nwith which they've evolved,\nand these are sounds that are vital\nto their very survival.\nThese new sounds\nare loud and they're alien.\nThey might impact the environment\nin ways that we think we understand,\nbut also in ways that we don't.\nRemember, sound is the most\nimportant sense for these animals.\nAnd not only is the physical habitat\nof the Arctic changing rapidly,\nbut the acoustic habitat is, too.\nIt's as if we've plucked these animals up\nfrom the quiet countryside\nand dropped them into a big city\nin the middle of rush hour.\nAnd they can't escape it.\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\nSo what can we do now?\nWe can't decrease wind speeds\nor keep subarctic animals\nfrom migrating north,\nbut we can work on local solutions\nto reducing human-caused underwater noise.\nOne of these solutions\nis to slow down ships\nthat traverse the Arctic,\nbecause a slower ship is a quieter ship.\nWe can restrict access\nin seasons and regions\nthat are important for mating\nor feeding or migrating.\nWe can get smarter about quieting ships\nand find better ways\nto explore the ocean bottom.\nAnd the good news is,\nthere are people\nworking on this right now.\nBut ultimately,\nwe humans have to do the hard work\nof reversing or at the very\nleast decelerating\nhuman-caused atmospheric changes.\n\n\n\n11:08\n\n\nSo, let's return to this idea\nof a silent world underwater.\nIt's entirely possible\nthat many of the whales\nswimming in the Arctic today,\nespecially long-lived species\nlike the bowhead whale\nthat the Inuits say can live\ntwo human lives —\nit's possible that these whales\nwere alive in 1956,\nwhen Jacques Cousteau made his film.\nAnd in retrospect,\nconsidering all the noise\nwe are creating in the oceans today,\nperhaps it really was \"The Silent World.\"\n\n\n\n11:43\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:45\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nThis is Lee Sedol.\nLee Sedol is one of the world's\ngreatest Go players,\nand he's having what my friends\nin Silicon Valley call\na \"Holy Cow\" moment —\n\n\n\n 0:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:22\n\n\na moment where we realize\nthat AI is actually progressing\na lot faster than we expected.\nSo humans have lost on the Go board.\nWhat about the real world?\n\n\n\n 0:32\n\n\nWell, the real world is much bigger,\nmuch more complicated than the Go board.\nIt's a lot less visible,\nbut it's still a decision problem.\nAnd if we think about some\nof the technologies\nthat are coming down the pike ...\nNoriko [Arai] mentioned that reading\nis not yet happening in machines,\nat least with understanding.\nBut that will happen,\nand when that happens,\nvery soon afterwards,\nmachines will have read everything\nthat the human race has ever written.\nAnd that will enable machines,\nalong with the ability to look\nfurther ahead than humans can,\nas we've already seen in Go,\nif they also have access\nto more information,\nthey'll be able to make better decisions\nin the real world than we can.\nSo is that a good thing?\nWell, I hope so.\n\n\n\n 1:25\n\n\nOur entire civilization,\neverything that we value,\nis based on our intelligence.\nAnd if we had access\nto a lot more intelligence,\nthen there's really no limit\nto what the human race can do.\nAnd I think this could be,\nas some people have described it,\nthe biggest event in human history.\nSo why are people saying things like this,\nthat AI might spell the end\nof the human race?\nIs this a new thing?\nIs it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates\nand Stephen Hawking?\n\n\n\n 2:00\n\n\nActually, no. This idea\nhas been around for a while.\nHere's a quotation:\n\"Even if we could keep the machines\nin a subservient position,\nfor instance, by turning off the power\nat strategic moments\" —\nand I'll come back to that\n\"turning off the power\" idea later on —\n\"we should, as a species,\nfeel greatly humbled.\"\nSo who said this?\nThis is Alan Turing in 1951.\nAlan Turing, as you know,\nis the father of computer science\nand in many ways,\nthe father of AI as well.\nSo if we think about this problem,\nthe problem of creating something\nmore intelligent than your own species,\nwe might call this \"the gorilla problem,\"\nbecause gorillas' ancestors did this\na few million years ago,\nand now we can ask the gorillas:\nWas this a good idea?\n\n\n\n 2:48\n\n\nSo here they are having a meeting\nto discuss whether it was a good idea,\nand after a little while,\nthey conclude, no,\nthis was a terrible idea.\nOur species is in dire straits.\nIn fact, you can see the existential\nsadness in their eyes.\n\n\n\n 3:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:05\n\n\nSo this queasy feeling that making\nsomething smarter than your own species\nis maybe not a good idea —\nwhat can we do about that?\nWell, really nothing,\nexcept stop doing AI,\nand because of all\nthe benefits that I mentioned\nand because I'm an AI researcher,\nI'm not having that.\nI actually want to be able\nto keep doing AI.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\nSo we actually need to nail down\nthe problem a bit more.\nWhat exactly is the problem?\nWhy is better AI possibly a catastrophe?\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nSo here's another quotation:\n\"We had better be quite sure\nthat the purpose put into the machine\nis the purpose which we really desire.\"\nThis was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960,\nshortly after he watched\none of the very early learning systems\nlearn to play checkers\nbetter than its creator.\nBut this could equally have been said\nby King Midas.\nKing Midas said, \"I want everything\nI touch to turn to gold,\"\nand he got exactly what he asked for.\nThat was the purpose\nthat he put into the machine,\nso to speak,\nand then his food and his drink\nand his relatives turned to gold\nand he died in misery and starvation.\nSo we'll call this\n\"the King Midas problem\"\nof stating an objective\nwhich is not, in fact,\ntruly aligned with what we want.\nIn modern terms, we call this\n\"the value alignment problem.\"\n\n\n\n 4:36\n\n\nPutting in the wrong objective\nis not the only part of the problem.\nThere's another part.\nIf you put an objective into a machine,\neven something as simple as,\n\"Fetch the coffee,\"\nthe machine says to itself,\n\"Well, how might I fail\nto fetch the coffee?\nSomeone might switch me off.\nOK, I have to take steps to prevent that.\nI will disable my 'off' switch.\nI will do anything to defend myself\nagainst interference\nwith this objective\nthat I have been given.\"\nSo this single-minded pursuit\nin a very defensive mode\nof an objective that is, in fact,\nnot aligned with the true objectives\nof the human race —\nthat's the problem that we face.\nAnd in fact, that's the high-value\ntakeaway from this talk.\nIf you want to remember one thing,\nit's that you can't fetch\nthe coffee if you're dead.\n\n\n\n 5:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nIt's very simple. Just remember that.\nRepeat it to yourself three times a day.\n\n\n\n 5:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:34\n\n\nAnd in fact, this is exactly the plot\nof \"2001: [A Space Odyssey]\"\nHAL has an objective, a mission,\nwhich is not aligned\nwith the objectives of the humans,\nand that leads to this conflict.\nNow fortunately, HAL\nis not superintelligent.\nHe's pretty smart,\nbut eventually Dave outwits him\nand manages to switch him off.\nBut we might not be so lucky.\nSo what are we going to do?\n\n\n\n 6:11\n\n\nI'm trying to redefine AI\nto get away from this classical notion\nof machines that intelligently\npursue objectives.\nThere are three principles involved.\nThe first one is a principle\nof altruism, if you like,\nthat the robot's only objective\nis to maximize the realization\nof human objectives,\nof human values.\nAnd by values here I don't mean\ntouchy-feely, goody-goody values.\nI just mean whatever it is\nthat the human would prefer\ntheir life to be like.\nAnd so this actually violates Asimov's law\nthat the robot has to protect\nits own existence.\nIt has no interest in preserving\nits existence whatsoever.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nThe second law is a law\nof humility, if you like.\nAnd this turns out to be really\nimportant to make robots safe.\nIt says that the robot does not know\nwhat those human values are,\nso it has to maximize them,\nbut it doesn't know what they are.\nAnd that avoids this problem\nof single-minded pursuit\nof an objective.\nThis uncertainty turns out to be crucial.\n\n\n\n 7:20\n\n\nNow, in order to be useful to us,\nit has to have some idea of what we want.\nIt obtains that information primarily\nby observation of human choices,\nso our own choices reveal information\nabout what it is that we prefer\nour lives to be like.\nSo those are the three principles.\nLet's see how that applies\nto this question of:\n\"Can you switch the machine off?\"\nas Turing suggested.\n\n\n\n 7:48\n\n\nSo here's a PR2 robot.\nThis is one that we have in our lab,\nand it has a big red \"off\" switch\nright on the back.\nThe question is: Is it\ngoing to let you switch it off?\nIf we do it the classical way,\nwe give it the objective of, \"Fetch\nthe coffee, I must fetch the coffee,\nI can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,\"\nso obviously the PR2\nhas been listening to my talk,\nand so it says, therefore,\n\"I must disable my 'off' switch,\nand probably taser all the other\npeople in Starbucks\nwho might interfere with me.\"\n\n\n\n 8:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nSo this seems to be inevitable, right?\nThis kind of failure mode\nseems to be inevitable,\nand it follows from having\na concrete, definite objective.\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\nSo what happens if the machine\nis uncertain about the objective?\nWell, it reasons in a different way.\nIt says, \"OK, the human\nmight switch me off,\nbut only if I'm doing something wrong.\nWell, I don't really know what wrong is,\nbut I know that I don't want to do it.\"\nSo that's the first and second\nprinciples right there.\n\"So I should let the human switch me off.\"\nAnd in fact you can calculate\nthe incentive that the robot has\nto allow the human to switch it off,\nand it's directly tied to the degree\nof uncertainty about\nthe underlying objective.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nAnd then when the machine is switched off,\nthat third principle comes into play.\nIt learns something about the objectives\nit should be pursuing,\nbecause it learns that\nwhat it did wasn't right.\nIn fact, we can, with suitable use\nof Greek symbols,\nas mathematicians usually do,\nwe can actually prove a theorem\nthat says that such a robot\nis provably beneficial to the human.\nYou are provably better off\nwith a machine that's designed in this way\nthan without it.\nSo this is a very simple example,\nbut this is the first step\nin what we're trying to do\nwith human-compatible AI.\n\n\n\n 9:41\n\n\nNow, this third principle,\nI think is the one that you're probably\nscratching your head over.\nYou're probably thinking, \"Well,\nyou know, I behave badly.\nI don't want my robot to behave like me.\nI sneak down in the middle of the night\nand take stuff from the fridge.\nI do this and that.\"\nThere's all kinds of things\nyou don't want the robot doing.\nBut in fact, it doesn't\nquite work that way.\nJust because you behave badly\ndoesn't mean the robot\nis going to copy your behavior.\nIt's going to understand your motivations\nand maybe help you resist them,\nif appropriate.\nBut it's still difficult.\nWhat we're trying to do, in fact,\nis to allow machines to predict\nfor any person and for any possible life\nthat they could live,\nand the lives of everybody else:\nWhich would they prefer?\nAnd there are many, many\ndifficulties involved in doing this;\nI don't expect that this\nis going to get solved very quickly.\nThe real difficulties, in fact, are us.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\n\nAs I have already mentioned,\nwe behave badly.\nIn fact, some of us are downright nasty.\nNow the robot, as I said,\ndoesn't have to copy the behavior.\nThe robot does not have\nany objective of its own.\nIt's purely altruistic.\nAnd it's not designed just to satisfy\nthe desires of one person, the user,\nbut in fact it has to respect\nthe preferences of everybody.\nSo it can deal with a certain\namount of nastiness,\nand it can even understand\nthat your nastiness, for example,\nyou may take bribes as a passport official\nbecause you need to feed your family\nand send your kids to school.\nIt can understand that;\nit doesn't mean it's going to steal.\nIn fact, it'll just help you\nsend your kids to school.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nWe are also computationally limited.\nLee Sedol is a brilliant Go player,\nbut he still lost.\nSo if we look at his actions,\nhe took an action that lost the game.\nThat doesn't mean he wanted to lose.\nSo to understand his behavior,\nwe actually have to invert\nthrough a model of human cognition\nthat includes our computational\nlimitations — a very complicated model.\nBut it's still something\nthat we can work on understanding.\n\n\n\n11:56\n\n\nProbably the most difficult part,\nfrom my point of view as an AI researcher,\nis the fact that there are lots of us,\nand so the machine has to somehow\ntrade off, weigh up the preferences\nof many different people,\nand there are different ways to do that.\nEconomists, sociologists,\nmoral philosophers have understood that,\nand we are actively\nlooking for collaboration.\n\n\n\n12:19\n\n\nLet's have a look and see what happens\nwhen you get that wrong.\nSo you can have\na conversation, for example,\nwith your intelligent personal assistant\nthat might be available\nin a few years' time.\nThink of a Siri on steroids.\nSo Siri says, \"Your wife called\nto remind you about dinner tonight.\"\nAnd of course, you've forgotten.\n\"What? What dinner?\nWhat are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\n\"Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm.\"\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\n\"I can't do that. I'm meeting\nwith the secretary-general at 7:30.\nHow could this have happened?\"\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\n\"Well, I did warn you, but you overrode\nmy recommendation.\"\n\n\n\n12:59\n\n\n\"Well, what am I going to do?\nI can't just tell him I'm too busy.\"\n\n\n\n13:03\n\n\n\"Don't worry. I arranged\nfor his plane to be delayed.\"\n\n\n\n13:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:09\n\n\n\"Some kind of computer malfunction.\"\n\n\n\n13:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\n\"Really? You can do that?\"\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\n\"He sends his profound apologies\nand looks forward to meeting you\nfor lunch tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n13:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:21\n\n\nSo the values here —\nthere's a slight mistake going on.\nThis is clearly following my wife's values\nwhich is \"Happy wife, happy life.\"\n\n\n\n13:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:32\n\n\nIt could go the other way.\nYou could come home\nafter a hard day's work,\nand the computer says, \"Long day?\"\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\n\"Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch.\"\n\n\n\n13:41\n\n\n\"You must be very hungry.\"\n\n\n\n13:42\n\n\n\"Starving, yeah.\nCould you make some dinner?\"\n\n\n\n13:47\n\n\n\"There's something I need to tell you.\"\n\n\n\n13:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:51\n\n\n\"There are humans in South Sudan\nwho are in more urgent need than you.\"\n\n\n\n13:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\n\"So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner.\"\n\n\n\n13:59\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:01\n\n\nSo we have to solve these problems,\nand I'm looking forward\nto working on them.\n\n\n\n14:06\n\n\nThere are reasons for optimism.\nOne reason is,\nthere is a massive amount of data.\nBecause remember — I said\nthey're going to read everything\nthe human race has ever written.\nMost of what we write about\nis human beings doing things\nand other people getting upset about it.\nSo there's a massive amount\nof data to learn from.\n\n\n\n14:22\n\n\nThere's also a very\nstrong economic incentive\nto get this right.\nSo imagine your domestic robot's at home.\nYou're late from work again\nand the robot has to feed the kids,\nand the kids are hungry\nand there's nothing in the fridge.\nAnd the robot sees the cat.\n\n\n\n14:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:39\n\n\nAnd the robot hasn't quite learned\nthe human value function properly,\nso it doesn't understand\nthe sentimental value of the cat outweighs\nthe nutritional value of the cat.\n\n\n\n14:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:51\n\n\nSo then what happens?\nWell, it happens like this:\n\"Deranged robot cooks kitty\nfor family dinner.\"\nThat one incident would be the end\nof the domestic robot industry.\nSo there's a huge incentive\nto get this right\nlong before we reach\nsuperintelligent machines.\n\n\n\n15:11\n\n\nSo to summarize:\nI'm actually trying to change\nthe definition of AI\nso that we have provably\nbeneficial machines.\nAnd the principles are:\nmachines that are altruistic,\nthat want to achieve only our objectives,\nbut that are uncertain\nabout what those objectives are,\nand will watch all of us\nto learn more about what it is\nthat we really want.\nAnd hopefully in the process,\nwe will learn to be better people.\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n15:38\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:41\n\n\nChris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart.\nWe're going to stand here a bit\nbecause I think they're setting up\nfor our next speaker.\n\n\n\n15:48\n\n\nA couple of questions.\nSo the idea of programming in ignorance\nseems intuitively really powerful.\nAs you get to superintelligence,\nwhat's going to stop a robot\nreading literature and discovering\nthis idea that knowledge\nis actually better than ignorance\nand still just shifting its own goals\nand rewriting that programming?\n\n\n\n16:08\n\n\nStuart Russell: Yes, so we want\nit to learn more, as I said,\nabout our objectives.\nIt'll only become more certain\nas it becomes more correct,\nso the evidence is there\nand it's going to be designed\nto interpret it correctly.\nIt will understand, for example,\nthat books are very biased\nin the evidence they contain.\nThey only talk about kings and princes\nand elite white male people doing stuff.\nSo it's a complicated problem,\nbut as it learns more about our objectives\nit will become more and more useful to us.\n\n\n\n16:45\n\n\nCA: And you couldn't\njust boil it down to one law,\nyou know, hardwired in:\n\"if any human ever tries to switch me off,\nI comply. I comply.\"\n\n\n\n16:54\n\n\nSR: Absolutely not.\nThat would be a terrible idea.\nSo imagine that you have\na self-driving car\nand you want to send your five-year-old\noff to preschool.\nDo you want your five-year-old\nto be able to switch off the car\nwhile it's driving along?\nProbably not.\nSo it needs to understand how rational\nand sensible the person is.\nThe more rational the person,\nthe more willing you are\nto be switched off.\nIf the person is completely\nrandom or even malicious,\nthen you're less willing\nto be switched off.\n\n\n\n17:23\n\n\nCA: All right. Stuart, can I just say,\nI really, really hope you\nfigure this out for us.\nThank you so much for that talk.\nThat was amazing.\n\n\n\n17:29\n\n\nSR: Thank you.\n\n\n\n17:31\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nHow many people here would like to live\nto be at least 80 years old?\nYeah.\nI think we all have\nthis hopeful expectation\nof living into old age.\nLet's project out into the future,\nto your future \"you's,\"\nand let's imagine that we're all 85.\nNow, everyone look at two people.\nOne of you probably has\nAlzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\nAlright, alright.\nAnd maybe you're thinking,\n\"Well, it won't be me.\"\nThen, OK. You are a caregiver.\nSo —\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:56\n\n\nso in some way,\nthis terrifying disease\nis likely to affect us all.\n\n\n\n 1:01\n\n\nPart of the fear around Alzheimer's\nstems from the sense\nthat there's nothing we can do about it.\nDespite decades of research, we still\nhave no disease-modifying treatment\nand no cure.\nSo if we're lucky enough\nto live long enough,\nAlzheimer's appears to be\nour brain's destiny.\n\n\n\n 1:20\n\n\nBut maybe it doesn't have to be.\nWhat if I told you we could\nchange these statistics,\nliterally change our brain's destiny,\nwithout relying on a cure\nor advancements in medicine?\n\n\n\n 1:32\n\n\nLet's begin by looking at\nwhat we currently understand\nabout the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.\nHere's a picture\nof two neurons connecting.\nThe point of connection,\nthis space circled in red,\nis called the synapse.\nThe synapse is where\nneurotransmitters are released.\nThis is where signals are transmitted,\nwhere communication happens.\nThis is where we think,\nfeel, see, hear, desire ...\nand remember.\nAnd the synapse\nis where Alzheimer's happens.\n\n\n\n 2:04\n\n\nLet's zoom in on the synapse\nand look at a cartoon representation\nof what's going on.\nDuring the business\nof communicating information,\nin addition to releasing neurotransmitters\nlike glutamate into the synapse,\nneurons also release a small peptide\ncalled amyloid beta.\nNormally, amyloid beta is cleared away\nmetabolized by microglia,\nthe janitor cells of our brains.\nWhile the molecular causes\nof Alzheimer's are still debated,\nmost neuroscientists believe\nthat the disease begins\nwhen amyloid beta begins to accumulate.\nToo much is released,\nor not enough is cleared away,\nand the synapse begins\nto pile up with amyloid beta.\nAnd when this happens, it binds to itself,\nforming sticky aggregates\ncalled amyloid plaques.\n\n\n\n 2:52\n\n\nHow many people here\nare 40 years old or older?\nYou're afraid to admit it now.\nThis initial step into the disease,\nthis presence of amyloid\nplaques accumulating,\ncan already be found in your brains.\nThe only way we could be sure of this\nwould be through a PET scan,\nbecause at this point,\nyou are blissfully unaware.\nYou're not showing any impairments\nin memory, language, or cognition ...\nyet.\nWe think it takes at least 15 to 20 years\nof amyloid plaque accumulation\nbefore it reaches a tipping point,\nthen triggering a molecular cascade\nthat causes the clinical\nsymptoms of the disease.\nPrior to the tipping point,\nyour lapses in memory\nmight include things like,\n\"Why did I come in this room?\"\nor \"Oh ... what's his name?\"\nor \"Where did I put my keys?\"\n\n\n\n 3:46\n\n\nNow, before you all\nstart freaking out again,\nbecause I know half of you did at least\none of those in the last 24 hours —\nthese are all normal kinds of forgetting.\nIn fact, I would argue that these examples\nmight not even involve your memory,\nbecause you didn't pay attention\nto where you put your keys\nin the first place.\nAfter the tipping point,\nthe glitches in memory,\nlanguage and cognition are different.\nInstead of eventually finding\nyour keys in your coat pocket\nor on the table by the door,\nyou find them in the refrigerator,\nor you find them and you think,\n\"What are these for?\"\n\n\n\n 4:23\n\n\nSo what happens when amyloid plaques\naccumulate to this tipping point?\nOur microglia janitor cells\nbecome hyper-activated,\nreleasing chemicals that cause\ninflammation and cellular damage.\nWe think they might actually\nstart clearing away\nthe synapses themselves.\nA crucial neural transport protein\ncalled \"tau\" becomes hyperphosphorylated\nand twists itself\ninto something called \"tangles,\"\nwhich choke off the neurons\nfrom the inside.\nBy mid-stage Alzheimer's,\nwe have massive inflammation and tangles\nand all-out war at the synapse\nand cell death.\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nSo if you were a scientist\ntrying to cure this disease,\nat what point would you ideally\nwant to intervene?\nMany scientists are betting big\non the simplest solution:\nkeep amyloid plaques\nfrom reaching that tipping point,\nwhich means that drug discovery is largely\nfocused on developing a compound\nthat will prevent, eliminate, or reduce\namyloid plaque accumulation.\nSo the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be\na preventative medicine.\nWe're going to have to take this pill\nbefore we reach that tipping point,\nbefore the cascade is triggered,\nbefore we start leaving\nour keys in the refrigerator.\nWe think this is why, to date,\nthese kinds of drugs have failed\nin clinical trials —\nnot because the science wasn't sound,\nbut because the people in these trials\nwere already symptomatic.\nIt was too late.\nThink of amyloid plaques as a lit match.\nAt the tipping point, the match\nsets fire to the forest.\nOnce the forest is ablaze,\nit doesn't do any good\nto blow out the match.\nYou have to blow out the match\nbefore the forest catches fire.\n\n\n\n 6:07\n\n\nEven before scientists sort this out,\nthis information is actually\nreally good news for us,\nbecause it turns out that the way we live\ncan influence the accumulation\nof amyloid plaques.\nAnd so there are things we can do\nto keep us from reaching\nthat tipping point.\n\n\n\n 6:22\n\n\nLet's picture your risk\nof Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.\nWe're going to pile\nrisk factors on one arm,\nand when that arm hits the floor,\nyou are symptomatic\nand diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\nLet's imagine you're 50 years old.\nYou're not a spring chicken anymore,\nso you've accumulated\nsome amyloid plaques with age.\nYour scale is tipped a little bit.\n\n\n\n 6:43\n\n\nNow let's look at your DNA.\nWe've all inherited our genes\nfrom our moms and our dads.\nSome of these genes will increase our risk\nand some will decrease it.\nIf you're like Alice in \"Still Alice,\"\nyou've inherited a rare genetic mutation\nthat cranks out amyloid beta,\nand this alone will tip\nyour scale arm to the ground.\nBut for most of us, the genes we inherit\nwill only tip the arm a bit.\nFor example, APOE4 is a gene variant\nthat increases amyloid,\nbut you can inherit a copy of APOE4\nfrom mom and dad\nand still never get Alzheimer's,\nwhich means that for most of us,\nour DNA alone does not determine\nwhether we get Alzheimer's.\nSo what does?\nWe can't do anything about getting older\nor the genes we've inherited.\nSo far, we haven't changed\nour brain's destiny.\n\n\n\n 7:34\n\n\nWhat about sleep?\nIn slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells\nrinse cerebral spinal fluid\nthroughout our brains,\nclearing away metabolic waste\nthat accumulated in our synapses\nwhile we were awake.\nDeep sleep is like\na power cleanse for the brain.\nBut what happens if you shortchange\nyourself on sleep?\nMany scientists believe\nthat poor sleep hygiene might actually\nbe a predictor of Alzheimer's.\nA single night of sleep deprivation\nleads to an increase in amyloid beta.\nAnd amyloid accumulation\nhas been shown to disrupt sleep,\nwhich in turn causes\nmore amyloid to accumulate.\nAnd so now we have\nthis positive feedback loop\nthat's going to accelerate\nthe tipping of that scale.\n\n\n\n 8:18\n\n\nWhat else?\nCardiovascular health.\nHigh blood pressure, diabetes,\nobesity, smoking, high cholesterol,\nhave all been shown to increase our risk\nof developing Alzheimer's.\nSome autopsy studies have shown\nthat as many as 80 percent\nof people with Alzheimer's\nalso had cardiovascular disease.\nAerobic exercise has been shown\nin many studies to decrease amyloid beta\nin animal models of the disease.\nSo a heart-healthy\nMediterranean lifestyle and diet\ncan help to counter\nthe tipping of this scale.\n\n\n\n 8:51\n\n\nSo there are many things we can do\nto prevent or delay\nthe onset of Alzheimer's.\nBut let's say\nyou haven't done any of them.\nLet's say you're 65;\nthere's Alzheimer's in your family,\nso you've likely inherited a gene or two\nthat tips your scale arm a bit;\nyou've been burning the candle\nat both ends for years;\nyou love bacon;\nand you don't run unless\nsomeone's chasing you.\n\n\n\n 9:13\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:15\n\n\nLet's imagine that your amyloid plaques\nhave reached that tipping point.\nYour scale arm has crashed to the floor.\nYou've tripped the cascade,\nsetting fire to the forest,\ncausing inflammation, tangles,\nand cell death.\nYou should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.\nYou should be having trouble\nfinding words and keys\nand remembering what I said\nat the beginning of this talk.\nBut you might not be.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nThere's one more thing you can do\nto protect yourself\nfrom experiencing\nthe symptoms of Alzheimer's,\neven if you have the full-blown disease\npathology ablaze in your brain.\nIt has to do with neural plasticity\nand cognitive reserve.\nRemember, the experience\nof having Alzheimer's\nis ultimately a result of losing synapses.\nThe average brain has\nover a hundred trillion synapses,\nwhich is fantastic;\nwe've got a lot to work with.\nAnd this isn't a static number.\nWe gain and lose synapses all the time,\nthrough a process\ncalled neural plasticity.\nEvery time we learn something new,\nwe are creating and strengthening\nnew neural connections,\nnew synapses.\n\n\n\n10:21\n\n\nIn the Nun Study,\n678 nuns, all over the age of 75\nwhen the study began,\nwere followed for more than two decades.\nThey were regularly given\nphysical checkups and cognitive tests,\nand when they died, their brains\nwere all donated for autopsy.\nIn some of these brains, scientists\ndiscovered something surprising.\nDespite the presence of plaques\nand tangles and brain shrinkage —\nwhat appeared to be\nunquestionable Alzheimer's —\nthe nuns who had belonged\nto these brains showed no signs\nof having the disease\nwhile they were alive.\n\n\n\n10:57\n\n\nHow can this be?\nWe think it's because these nuns\nhad a high level of cognitive reserve,\nwhich is a way of saying that they had\nmore functional synapses.\nPeople who have more years\nof formal education,\nwho have a high degree of literacy,\nwho engage regularly\nin mentally stimulating activities,\nall have more cognitive reserve.\nThey have an abundance\nand a redundancy in neural connections.\nSo even if they have a disease\nlike Alzheimer's\ncompromising some of their synapses,\nthey've got many extra backup connections,\nand this buffers them from noticing\nthat anything is amiss.\n\n\n\n11:33\n\n\nLet's imagine a simplified example.\nLet's say you only know one thing\nabout a subject.\nLet's say it's about me.\nYou know that Lisa Genova\nwrote \"Still Alice,\"\nand that's the only thing\nyou know about me.\nYou have that single neural connection,\nthat one synapse.\nNow imagine you have Alzheimer's.\nYou have plaques and tangles\nand inflammation\nand microglia devouring that synapse.\nNow when someone asks you,\n\"Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'\"\nyou can't remember,\nbecause that synapse\nis either failing or gone.\nYou've forgotten me forever.\n\n\n\n12:08\n\n\nBut what if you had learned more about me?\nLet's say you learned\nfour things about me.\nNow imagine you have Alzheimer's,\nand three of those synapses\nare damaged or destroyed.\nYou still have a way\nto detour the wreckage.\nYou can still remember my name.\nSo we can be resilient\nto the presence of Alzheimer's pathology\nthrough the recruitment\nof yet-undamaged pathways.\nAnd we create these pathways,\nthis cognitive reserve,\nby learning new things.\nIdeally, we want these new things\nto be as rich in meaning as possible,\nrecruiting sight and sound\nand associations and emotion.\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\nSo this really doesn't mean\ndoing crossword puzzles.\nYou don't want to simply retrieve\ninformation you've already learned,\nbecause this is like traveling\ndown old, familiar streets,\ncruising neighborhoods you already know.\nYou want to pave new neural roads.\nBuilding an Alzheimer's-resistant brain\nmeans learning to speak Italian,\nmeeting new friends,\nreading a book,\nor listening to a great TED Talk.\n\n\n\n13:14\n\n\nAnd if, despite all of this, you are\nsomeday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,\nthere are three lessons I've learned\nfrom my grandmother\nand the dozens of people I've come to know\nliving with this disease.\nDiagnosis doesn't mean\nyou're dying tomorrow.\nKeep living.\nYou won't lose your emotional memory.\nYou'll still be able\nto understand love and joy.\nYou might not remember\nwhat I said five minutes ago,\nbut you'll remember how I made you feel.\nAnd you are more than what\nyou can remember.\n\n\n\n13:47\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:48\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nAs patients,\nwe usually remember\nthe names of our doctors,\nbut often we forget\nthe names of our nurses.\nI remember one.\nI had breast cancer a few years ago,\nand somehow I managed\nto get through the surgeries\nand the beginning\nof the treatment just fine.\nI could hide what was going on.\nEverybody didn't really have to know.\nI could walk my daughter to school,\nI could go out to dinner with my husband;\nI could fool people.\nBut then my chemo was scheduled to begin\nand that terrified me\nbecause I knew that I was going to lose\nevery single hair on my body\nbecause of the kind of chemo\nthat I was going to have.\nI wasn't going to be able\nto pretend anymore\nas though everything was normal.\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\nI was scared.\nI knew what it felt like to have\neverybody treating me with kid gloves,\nand I just wanted to feel normal.\nI had a port installed in my chest.\nI went to my first day of chemotherapy,\nand I was an emotional wreck.\nMy nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,\nand every bone in my body was telling\nme to get up out of that chair\nand take for the hills.\nBut Joanne looked at me and talked\nto me like we were old friends.\nAnd then she asked me,\n\"Where'd you get your highlights done?\"\n\n\n\n 1:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\nAnd I was like, are you kidding me?\nYou're going to talk to me about my hair\nwhen I'm on the verge of losing it?\nI was kind of angry,\nand I said, \"Really? Hair?\"\nAnd with a shrug\nof her shoulders she said,\n\"It's gonna grow back.\"\nAnd in that moment she said\nthe one thing I had overlooked,\nand that was that at some point,\nmy life would get back to normal.\nShe really believed that.\nAnd so I believed it, too.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nNow, worrying about losing your hair\nwhen you're fighting cancer\nmay seem silly at first,\nbut it's not just that you're worried\nabout how you're going to look.\nIt's that you're worried that everybody's\ngoing to treat you so carefully.\nJoanne made me feel normal\nfor the first time in six months.\nWe talked about her boyfriends,\nwe talked about looking\nfor apartments in New York City,\nand we talked about my reaction\nto the chemotherapy —\nall kind of mixed in together.\nAnd I always wondered,\nhow did she so instinctively\nknow just how to talk to me?\n\n\n\n 2:34\n\n\nJoanne Staha and my admiration for her\nmarked the beginning of my journey\ninto the world of nurses.\nA few years later,\nI was asked to do a project\nthat would celebrate\nthe work that nurses do.\nI started with Joanne,\nand I met over 100 nurses\nacross the country.\nI spent five years interviewing,\nphotographing and filming nurses\nfor a book and a documentary film.\nWith my team,\nwe mapped a trip across America\nthat would take us to places\ndealing with some of the biggest\npublic health issues facing our nation —\naging, war, poverty, prisons.\nAnd then we went places\nwhere we would find\nthe largest concentration of patients\ndealing with those issues.\nThen we asked hospitals and facilities\nto nominate nurses\nwho would best represent them.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\nOne of the first nurses I met\nwas Bridget Kumbella.\nBridget was born in Cameroon,\nthe oldest of four children.\nHer father was at work\nwhen he had fallen from the fourth floor\nand really hurt his back.\nAnd he talked a lot about what it was like\nto be flat on your back\nand not get the kind\nof care that you need.\nAnd that propelled Bridget\nto go into the profession of nursing.\nNow, as a nurse in the Bronx,\nshe has a really diverse group\nof patients that she cares for,\nfrom all walks of life,\nand from all different religions.\nAnd she's devoted her career\nto understanding the impact\nof our cultural differences\nwhen it comes to our health.\nShe spoke of a patient —\na Native American patient that she had —\nthat wanted to bring\na bunch of feathers into the ICU.\nThat's how he found spiritual comfort.\nAnd she spoke of advocating for him\nand said that patients come\nfrom all different religions\nand use all different kinds\nof objects for comfort;\nwhether it's a holy rosary\nor a symbolic feather,\nit all needs to be supported.\n\n\n\n 4:40\n\n\nThis is Jason Short.\nJason is a home health nurse\nin the Appalachian mountains,\nand his dad had a gas station\nand a repair shop when he was growing up.\nSo he worked on cars in the community\nthat he now serves as a nurse.\nWhen he was in college,\nit was just not macho at all\nto become a nurse,\nso he avoided it for years.\nHe drove trucks for a little while,\nbut his life path was always\npulling him back to nursing.\nAs a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,\nJason goes places\nthat an ambulance can't even get to.\nIn this photograph,\nhe's standing in what used to be a road.\nTop of the mountain mining\nflooded that road,\nand now the only way\nfor Jason to get to the patient\nliving in that house\nwith black lung disease\nis to drive his SUV\nagainst the current up that creek.\nThe day I was with him,\nwe ripped the front fender off the car.\nThe next morning he got up,\nput the car on the lift,\nfixed the fender,\nand then headed out\nto meet his next patient.\nI witnessed Jason\ncaring for this gentleman\nwith such enormous compassion,\nand I was struck again by how intimate\nthe work of nursing really is.\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nWhen I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.\nHe had just come back from a deployment\nand he hadn't really settled back in\nto life in San Diego yet.\nHe talked about his experience\nof being a nurse in Germany\nand taking care of the soldiers\ncoming right off the battlefield.\nVery often, he would be\nthe first person they would see\nwhen they opened\ntheir eyes in the hospital.\nAnd they would look at him\nas they were lying there,\nmissing limbs,\nand the first thing they would say is,\n\"When can I go back?\nI left my brothers out there.\"\nAnd Brian would have to say,\n\"You're not going anywhere.\nYou've already given enough, brother.\"\nBrian is both a nurse and a soldier\nwho's seen combat.\nSo that puts him in a unique position\nto be able to relate to and help heal\nthe veterans in his care.\n\n\n\n 6:52\n\n\nThis is Sister Stephen,\nand she runs a nursing home\nin Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.\nAnd the entire circle of life\ncan be found under her roof.\nShe grew up wishing they lived on a farm,\nso given the opportunity\nto adopt local farm animals,\nshe enthusiastically brings them in.\nAnd in the springtime,\nthose animals have babies.\nAnd Sister Stephen uses\nthose baby ducks, goats and lambs\nas animal therapy\nfor the residents at Villa Loretto\nwho sometimes can't\nremember their own name,\nbut they do rejoice\nin the holding of a baby lamb.\nThe day I was with Sister Stephen,\nI needed to take her away\nfrom Villa Loretto\nto film part of her story.\nAnd before we left,\nshe went into the room of a dying patient.\nAnd she leaned over and she said,\n\"I have to go away for the day,\nbut if Jesus calls you,\nyou go.\nYou go straight home to Jesus.\"\nI was standing there and thinking\nit was the first time in my life\nI witnessed that you could show\nsomeone you love them completely\nby letting go.\nWe don't have to hold on so tightly.\nI saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto\nthan I have ever seen at any other time\nat any other place in my life.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nWe live in a complicated time\nwhen it comes to our health care.\nIt's easy to lose sight\nof the need for quality of life,\nnot just quantity of life.\nAs new life-saving\ntechnologies are created,\nwe're going to have really\ncomplicated decisions to make.\nThese technologies often save lives,\nbut they can also prolong pain\nand the dying process.\nHow in the world are we supposed\nto navigate these waters?\nWe're going to need\nall the help we can get.\nNurses have a really unique\nrelationship with us\nbecause of the time spent at bedside.\nDuring that time,\na kind of emotional intimacy develops.\n\n\n\n 9:05\n\n\nThis past summer, on August 9,\nmy father died of a heart attack.\nMy mother was devastated,\nand she couldn't imagine\nher world without him in it.\nFour days later she fell,\nshe broke her hip,\nshe needed surgery\nand she found herself\nfighting for her own life.\nOnce again I found myself\non the receiving end\nof the care of nurses —\nthis time for my mom.\nMy brother and my sister and I\nstayed by her side\nfor the next three days in the ICU.\nAnd as we tried\nto make the right decisions\nand follow my mother's wishes,\nwe found that we were depending\nupon the guidance of nurses.\nAnd once again,\nthey didn't let us down.\nThey had an amazing insight\nin terms of how to care for my mom\nin the last four days of her life.\nThey brought her comfort\nand relief from pain.\nThey knew to encourage my sister and I\nto put a pretty nightgown on my mom,\nlong after it mattered to her,\nbut it sure meant a lot to us.\nAnd they knew to come and wake me up\njust in time for my mom's last breath.\nAnd then they knew\nhow long to leave me in the room\nwith my mother after she died.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nI have no idea how they know these things,\nbut I do know that I am eternally grateful\nthat they've guided me once again.\n\n\n\n10:39\n\n\nThank you so very much.\n\n\n\n10:41\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nA few days after my husband Paul\nwas diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,\nwe were lying in our bed at home,\nand Paul said,\n\"It's going to be OK.\"\nAnd I remember answering back,\n\"Yes.\nWe just don't know what OK means yet.\"\n\n\n\n 0:34\n\n\nPaul and I had met as first-year\nmedical students at Yale.\nHe was smart and kind and super funny.\nHe used to keep a gorilla suit\nin the trunk of his car,\nand he'd say, \"It's for emergencies only.\"\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nI fell in love with Paul as I watched\nthe care he took with his patients.\nHe stayed late talking with them,\nseeking to understand\nthe experience of illness\nand not just its technicalities.\nHe later told me he fell in love with me\nwhen he saw me cry over an EKG\nof a heart that had ceased beating.\nWe didn't know it yet,\nbut even in the heady days of young love,\nwe were learning how\nto approach suffering together.\n\n\n\n 1:21\n\n\nWe got married and became doctors.\nI was working as an internist\nand Paul was finishing his training\nas a neurosurgeon\nwhen he started to lose weight.\nHe developed excruciating back pain\nand a cough that wouldn't go away.\nAnd when he was admitted to the hospital,\na CT scan revealed tumors\nin Paul's lungs and in his bones.\nWe had both cared for patients\nwith devastating diagnoses;\nnow it was our turn.\n\n\n\n 1:57\n\n\nWe lived with Paul's illness\nfor 22 months.\nHe wrote a memoir about facing mortality.\nI gave birth to our daughter Cady,\nand we loved her and each other.\nWe learned directly how to struggle\nthrough really tough medical decisions.\nThe day we took Paul\ninto the hospital for the last time\nwas the most difficult day of my life.\nWhen he turned to me at the end\nand said, \"I'm ready,\"\nI knew that wasn't just a brave decision.\nIt was the right one.\nPaul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.\nIn that moment,\nthe most important thing to Paul\nwas to hold our baby daughter.\nNine hours later,\nPaul died.\n\n\n\n 2:54\n\n\nI've always thought of myself\nas a caregiver —\nmost physicians do —\nand taking care of Paul\ndeepened what that meant.\nWatching him reshape\nhis identity during his illness,\nlearning to witness and accept his pain,\ntalking together through his choices —\nthose experiences taught me\nthat resilience does not mean\nbouncing back to where you were before,\nor pretending that\nthe hard stuff isn't hard.\nIt is so hard.\nIt's painful, messy stuff.\nBut it's the stuff.\nAnd I learned that when we\napproach it together,\nwe get to decide what success looks like.\n\n\n\n 3:42\n\n\nOne of the first things\nPaul said to me after his diagnosis was,\n\"I want you to get remarried.\"\nAnd I was like, whoa, I guess\nwe get to say anything out loud.\n\n\n\n 3:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:55\n\n\nIt was so shocking\nand heartbreaking ...\nand generous,\nand really comforting\nbecause it was so starkly honest,\nand that honesty turned out\nto be exactly what we needed.\nEarly in Paul's illness,\nwe agreed we would\njust keep saying things out loud.\nTasks like making a will,\nor completing our advance directives —\ntasks that I had always avoided —\nwere not as daunting as they once seemed.\nI realized that completing\nan advance directive is an act of love —\nlike a wedding vow.\nA pact to take care of someone,\ncodifying the promise\nthat til death do us part,\nI will be there.\nIf needed, I will speak for you.\nI will honor your wishes.\nThat paperwork became\na tangible part of our love story.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\nAs physicians,\nPaul and I were in a good position\nto understand and even\naccept his diagnosis.\nWe weren't angry about it,\nluckily,\nbecause we'd seen so many patients\nin devastating situations,\nand we knew that death is a part of life.\nBut it's one thing to know that;\nit was a very different experience\nto actually live with the sadness\nand uncertainty of a serious illness.\nHuge strides are being made\nagainst lung cancer,\nbut we knew that Paul likely had\nmonths to a few years left to live.\n\n\n\n 5:35\n\n\nDuring that time,\nPaul wrote about his transition\nfrom doctor to patient.\nHe talked about feeling\nlike he was suddenly at a crossroads,\nand how he would have thought\nhe'd be able to see the path,\nthat because he treated so many patients,\nmaybe he could follow in their footsteps.\nBut he was totally disoriented.\nRather than a path,\nPaul wrote,\n\"I saw instead\nonly a harsh, vacant,\ngleaming white desert.\nAs if a sandstorm\nhad erased all familiarity.\nI had to face my mortality\nand try to understand\nwhat made my life worth living,\nand I needed my oncologist's\nhelp to do so.\"\n\n\n\n 6:26\n\n\nThe clinicians taking care of Paul\ngave me an even deeper appreciation\nfor my colleagues in health care.\nWe have a tough job.\nWe're responsible for helping patients\nhave clarity around their prognoses\nand their treatment options,\nand that's never easy,\nbut it's especially tough\nwhen you're dealing with potentially\nterminal illnesses like cancer.\nSome people don't want to know\nhow long they have left,\nothers do.\nEither way, we never have those answers.\nSometimes we substitute hope\nby emphasizing the best-case scenario.\nIn a survey of physicians,\n55 percent said\nthey painted a rosier picture\nthan their honest opinion\nwhen describing a patient's prognosis.\nIt's an instinct born out of kindness.\nBut researchers have found\nthat when people better understand\nthe possible outcomes of an illness,\nthey have less anxiety,\ngreater ability to plan\nand less trauma for their families.\n\n\n\n 7:39\n\n\nFamilies can struggle\nwith those conversations,\nbut for us, we also found that information\nimmensely helpful with big decisions.\nMost notably,\nwhether to have a baby.\nMonths to a few years meant\nPaul was not likely to see her grow up.\nBut he had a good chance\nof being there for her birth\nand for the beginning of her life.\nI remember asking Paul\nif he thought having\nto say goodbye to a child\nwould make dying even more painful.\nAnd his answer astounded me.\nHe said,\n\"Wouldn't it be great if it did?\"\nAnd we did it.\nNot in order to spite cancer,\nbut because we were learning\nthat living fully\nmeans accepting suffering.\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nPaul's oncologist tailored his chemo\nso he could continue\nworking as a neurosurgeon,\nwhich initially we thought\nwas totally impossible.\nWhen the cancer advanced\nand Paul shifted from surgery to writing,\nhis palliative care doctor\nprescribed a stimulant medication\nso he could be more focused.\nThey asked Paul about\nhis priorities and his worries.\nThey asked him what trade-offs\nhe was willing to make.\nThose conversations\nare the best way to ensure\nthat your health care matches your values.\nPaul joked that it's not\nlike that \"birds and bees\" talk\nyou have with your parents,\nwhere you all get it over with\nas quickly as possible,\nand then pretend it never happened.\nYou revisit the conversation\nas things change.\nYou keep saying things out loud.\nI'm forever grateful\nbecause Paul's clinicians felt\nthat their job wasn't to try\nto give us answers they didn't have,\nor only to try to fix things for us,\nbut to counsel Paul\nthrough painful choices ...\nwhen his body was failing\nbut his will to live wasn't.\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nLater, after Paul died,\nI received a dozen bouquets of flowers,\nbut I sent just one ...\nto Paul's oncologist,\nbecause she supported his goals\nand she helped him weigh his choices.\nShe knew that living\nmeans more than just staying alive.\n\n\n\n10:24\n\n\nA few weeks ago,\na patient came into my clinic.\nA woman dealing\nwith a serious chronic disease.\nAnd while we were talking\nabout her life and her health care,\nshe said, \"I love my palliative care team.\nThey taught me that it's OK to say 'no'.\"\nYeah, I thought, of course it is.\nBut many patients don't feel that.\nCompassion and Choices did a study\nwhere they asked people\nabout their health care preferences.\nAnd a lot of people\nstarted their answers with the words\n\"Well, if I had a choice ...\"\nIf I had a choice.\nAnd when I read that \"if,\"\nI understood better\nwhy one in four people\nreceives excessive or unwanted\nmedical treatment,\nor watches a family member receive\nexcessive or unwanted medical treatment.\nIt's not because doctors don't get it.\nWe do.\nWe understand the real\npsychological consequences\non patients and their families.\nThe things is, we deal with them, too.\nHalf of critical care nurses\nand a quarter of ICU doctors\nhave considered quitting their jobs\nbecause of distress over feeling\nthat for some of their patients,\nthey've provided care\nthat didn't fit with the person's values.\nBut doctors can't make sure\nyour wishes are respected\nuntil they know what they are.\n\n\n\n12:03\n\n\nWould you want to be on life support\nif it offered any chance of longer life?\nAre you most worried\nabout the quality of that time,\nrather than quantity?\nBoth of those choices\nare thoughtful and brave,\nbut for all of us, it's our choice.\nThat's true at the end of life\nand for medical care throughout our lives.\nIf you're pregnant,\ndo you want genetic screening?\nIs a knee replacement right or not?\nDo you want to do dialysis\nin a clinic or at home?\nThe answer is:\nit depends.\nWhat medical care will help you\nlive the way you want to?\nI hope you remember that question\nthe next time you face\na decision in your health care.\nRemember that you always have a choice,\nand it is OK to say no to a treatment\nthat's not right for you.\n\n\n\n13:05\n\n\nThere's a poem by W.S. Merwin —\nit's just two sentences long —\nthat captures how I feel now.\n\"Your absence has gone through me\nlike thread through a needle.\nEverything I do\nis stitched with its color.\"\nFor me that poem evokes my love for Paul,\nand a new fortitude\nthat came from loving and losing him.\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\nWhen Paul said, \"It's going to be OK,\"\nthat didn't mean\nthat we could cure his illness.\nInstead, we learned to accept\nboth joy and sadness at the same time;\nto uncover beauty and purpose\nboth despite and because we are all born\nand we all die.\nAnd for all the sadness\nand sleepless nights,\nit turns out there is joy.\nI leave flowers on Paul's grave\nand watch our two-year-old\nrun around on the grass.\nI build bonfires on the beach\nand watch the sunset with our friends.\nExercise and mindfulness\nmeditation have helped a lot.\nAnd someday,\nI hope I do get remarried.\n\n\n\n14:35\n\n\nMost importantly,\nI get to watch our daughter grow.\nI've thought a lot\nabout what I'm going to say to her\nwhen she's older.\n\"Cady,\nengaging in the full\nrange of experience —\nliving and dying,\nlove and loss —\nis what we get to do.\nBeing human doesn't happen\ndespite suffering.\nIt happens within it.\nWhen we approach suffering together,\nwhen we choose not to hide from it,\nour lives don't diminish,\nthey expand.\"\n\n\n\n15:20\n\n\nI've learned that cancer\nisn't always a battle.\nOr if it is,\nmaybe it's a fight for something\ndifferent than we thought.\nOur job isn't to fight fate,\nbut to help each other through.\nNot as soldiers\nbut as shepherds.\nThat's how we make it OK,\neven when it's not.\nBy saying it out loud,\nby helping each other through ...\nand a gorilla suit never hurts, either.\n\n\n\n15:59\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nChris Anderson: So Robert\nspent the last few years\nthink about how weird human behavior is,\nand how inadequate most\nof our language trying to explain it is.\nAnd it's very exciting to hear him\nexplain some of the thinking behind it\nin public for the first time.\nOver to you now, Robert Sapolsky.\n\n\n\n 0:29\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 0:34\n\n\nRobert Sapolsky: Thank you.\nThe fantasy always runs\nsomething like this.\nI've overpowered his elite guard,\nburst into his secret bunker\nwith my machine gun ready.\nHe lunges for his Luger.\nI knock it out of his hand.\nHe lunges for his cyanide pill.\nI knock that out of his hand.\nHe snarls,\ncomes at me with otherworldly strength.\nWe grapple, we fight,\nI manage to pin him down\nand put on handcuffs.\n\"Adolf Hitler,\" I say,\n\"I arrest you for crimes\nagainst humanity.\"\n\n\n\n 1:09\n\n\nHere's where the Medal of Honor\nversion of the fantasy ends\nand the imagery darkens.\nWhat would I do if I had Hitler?\nIt's not hard to imagine\nonce I allow myself.\nSever his spine at the neck.\nTake out his eyes with a blunt instrument.\nPuncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.\nLeave him alive on a respirator,\ntube-fed, not able to speak\nor move or see or hear, just to feel,\nand then inject him\nwith something cancerous\nthat's going to fester and pustulate\nuntil every cell in his body\nis screaming in agony,\nuntil every second\nfeels like an eternity in hell.\nThat's what I would do to Hitler.\n\n\n\n 1:52\n\n\nI've had this fantasy since I was a kid,\nstill do sometimes,\nand when I do, my heart speeds up —\nall these plans for the most evil,\nwicked soul in history.\nBut there's a problem,\nwhich is I don't actually believe\nin souls or evil,\nand I think wicked belongs in a musical.\nBut there's some people\nI would like to see killed,\nbut I'm against the death penalty.\nBut I like schlocky violent movies,\nbut I'm for strict gun control.\nBut then there was a time\nI was at a laser tag place,\nand I had such a good time\nhiding in a corner shooting at people.\nIn other words, I'm your basic\nconfused human when it comes to violence.\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\nNow, as a species, we obviously\nhave problems with violence.\nWe use shower heads to deliver poison gas,\nletters with anthrax,\nairplanes as weapons,\nmass rape as a military strategy.\nWe're a miserably violent species.\nBut there's a complication,\nwhich is we don't hate violence,\nwe hate the wrong kind.\nAnd when it's the right kind,\nwe cheer it on, we hand out medals,\nwe vote for, we mate with\nour champions of it.\nWhen it's the right kind of violence,\nwe love it.\nAnd there's another complication,\nwhich is, in addition to us\nbeing this miserably violent species,\nwe're also this extraordinarily\naltruistic, compassionate one.\n\n\n\n 3:14\n\n\nSo how do you make sense\nof the biology of our best behaviors,\nour worst ones and all of those\nambiguously in between?\n\n\n\n 3:21\n\n\nNow, for starters,\nwhat's totally boring is understanding\nthe motoric aspects of the behavior.\nYour brain tells your spine,\ntells your muscles\nto do something or other,\nand hooray, you've behaved.\nWhat's hard is understanding\nthe meaning of the behavior,\nbecause in some settings,\npulling a trigger is an appalling act;\nin others, it's heroically\nself-sacrificial.\nIn some settings, putting your hand\none someone else's\nis deeply compassionate.\nIn others, it's a deep betrayal.\nThe challenge is to understand\nthe biology of the context\nof our behaviors,\nand that's real tough.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nOne thing that's clear, though,\nis you're not going to get anywhere\nif you think there's going to be\nthe brain region or the hormone\nor the gene or the childhood experience\nor the evolutionary mechanism\nthat explains everything.\nInstead, every bit of behavior\nhas multiple levels of causality.\n\n\n\n 4:17\n\n\nLet's look at an example.\nYou have a gun.\nThere's a crisis going on:\nrioting, violence, people running around.\nA stranger is running at you\nin an agitated state —\nyou can't quite tell if the expression\nis frightened, threatening, angry —\nholding something\nthat kind of looks like a handgun.\nYou're not sure.\nThe stranger comes running at you\nand you pull the trigger.\nAnd it turns out\nthat thing in this person's hand\nwas a cell phone.\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\nSo we asked this biological question:\nwhat was going on\nthat caused this behavior?\nWhat caused this behavior?\nAnd this is a multitude of questions.\n\n\n\n 4:56\n\n\nWe start.\nWhat was going on in your brain\none second before you pulled that trigger?\nAnd this brings us into the realm\nof a brain region called the amygdala.\nThe amygdala, which is\ncentral to violence, central to fear,\ninitiates volleys of cascades\nthat produce pulling of a trigger.\nWhat was the level of activity\nin your amygdala one second before?\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nBut to understand that,\nwe have to step back a little bit.\nWhat was going on in the environment\nseconds to minutes before\nthat impacted the amygdala?\nNow, obviously, the sights,\nthe sounds of the rioting,\nthat was pertinent.\nBut in addition,\nyou're more likely to mistake\na cell phone for a handgun\nif that stranger was male\nand large and of a different race.\nFurthermore, if you're in pain,\nif you're hungry, if you're exhausted,\nyour frontal cortex\nis not going to work as well,\npart of the brain whose job it is\nto get to the amygdala in time\nsaying, \"Are you really sure\nthat's a gun there?\"\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nBut we need to step further back.\nNow we have to look\nat hours to days before,\nand with this, we have entered\nthe realm of hormones.\nFor example, testosterone,\nwhere regardless of your sex,\nif you have elevated\ntestosterone levels in your blood,\nyou're more likely to think\na face with a neutral expression\nis instead looking threatening.\nElevated testosterone levels,\nelevated levels of stress hormones,\nand your amygdala\nis going to be more active\nand your frontal cortex\nwill be more sluggish.\n\n\n\n 6:28\n\n\nPushing back further,\nweeks to months before,\nwhere's the relevance there?\nThis is the realm of neural plasticity,\nthe fact that your brain\ncan change in response to experience,\nand if your previous months\nhave been filled with stress and trauma,\nyour amygdala will have enlarged.\nThe neurons will have become\nmore excitable,\nyour frontal cortex would have atrophied,\nall relevant to what happens\nin that one second.\n\n\n\n 6:53\n\n\nBut we push back even more, back years,\nback, for example, to your adolescence.\nNow, the central fact\nof the adolescent brain\nis all of it is going full blast\nexcept the frontal cortex,\nwhich is still half-baked.\nIt doesn't fully mature\nuntil you're around 25.\nAnd thus, adolescence and early adulthood\nare the years where environment\nand experience sculpt your frontal cortex\ninto the version you're going to have\nas an adult in that critical moment.\n\n\n\n 7:23\n\n\nBut pushing back even further,\neven further back\nto childhood and fetal life\nand all the different versions\nthat that could come in.\nNow, obviously, that's the time\nthat your brain is being constructed,\nand that's important,\nbut in addition,\nexperience during those times\nproduce what are called\nepigenetic changes,\npermanent, in some cases,\npermanently activating\ncertain genes, turning off others.\nAnd as an example of this,\nif as a fetus you were exposed to a lot\nof stress hormones through your mother,\nepigenetics is going to produce\nyour amygdala in adulthood\nas a more excitable form,\nand you're going to have\nelevated stress hormone levels.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\nBut pushing even further back,\nback to when you were just a fetus,\nback to when all you were\nwas a collection of genes.\nNow, genes are really\nimportant to all of this,\nbut critically, genes don't\ndetermine anything,\nbecause genes work differently\nin different environments.\nKey example here:\nthere's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,\nand if you have that variant,\nyou are far more likely\nto commit antisocial violence\nif, and only if,\nyou were abused as a child.\nGenes and environment interact,\nand what's happening in that one second\nbefore you pull that trigger\nreflects your lifetime\nof those gene-environment interactions.\n\n\n\n 8:45\n\n\nNow, remarkably enough,\nwe've got to push even further back now,\nback centuries.\nWhat were your ancestors up to.\nAnd if, for example,\nthey were nomadic pastoralists,\nthey were pastoralists,\npeople living in deserts or grasslands\nwith their herds of camels, cows, goats,\nodds are they would have invented\nwhat's called a culture of honor\nfilled with warrior classes,\nretributive violence, clan vendettas,\nand amazingly, centuries later,\nthat would still be influencing\nthe values with which you were raised.\n\n\n\n 9:18\n\n\nBut we've got to push even further back,\nback millions of years,\nbecause if we're talking about genes,\nimplicitly we're now talking\nabout the evolution of genes.\nAnd what you see is, for example,\npatterns across different primate species.\nSome of them have evolved\nfor extremely low levels of aggression,\nothers have evolved\nin the opposite direction,\nand floating there in between\nby every measure are humans,\nonce again this confused,\nbarely defined species\nthat has all these potentials\nto go one way or the other.\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\nSo what has this gotten us to?\nBasically, what we're seeing here is,\nif you want to understand a behavior,\nwhether it's an appalling one,\na wondrous one,\nor confusedly in between,\nif you want to understand that,\nyou've got take into account\nwhat happened a second before\nto a million years before,\neverything in between.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nSo what can we conclude at this point?\nOfficially, it's complicated.\nWow, that's really helpful.\nIt's complicated,\nand you'd better be\nreal careful, real cautious\nbefore you conclude\nyou know what causes a behavior,\nespecially if it's a behavior\nyou're judging harshly.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nNow, to me, the single most important\npoint about all of this\nis one having to do with change.\nEvery bit of biology I have mentioned here\ncan change in different circumstances.\nFor example, ecosystems change.\nThousands of years ago,\nthe Sahara was a lush grassland.\nCultures change.\nIn the 17th century, the most terrifying\npeople in Europe were the Swedes,\nrampaging all over the place.\nThis is what the Swedish\nmilitary does now.\nThey haven't had a war in 200 years.\nMost importantly,\nbrains change.\nNeurons grow new processes.\nCircuits disconnect.\nEverything in the brain changes,\nand out of this come extraordinary\nexamples of human change.\n\n\n\n11:16\n\n\nFirst one:\nthis is a man named John Newton,\na British theologian\nwho played a central role in the abolition\nof slavery from the British Empire\nin the early 1800s.\nAnd amazingly, this man\nspent decades as a younger man\nas the captain of a slave ship,\nand then as an investor in slavery,\ngrowing rich from this.\nAnd then something changed.\nSomething changed in him,\nsomething that Newton himself celebrated\nin the thing that he's most famous for,\na hymn that he wrote:\n\"Amazing Grace.\"\n\n\n\n11:54\n\n\nThis is a man named Zenji Abe\non the morning of December 6, 1941,\nabout to lead a squadron of Japanese\nbombers to attack Pearl Harbor.\nAnd this is the same man\n50 years later to the day\nhugging a man who survived\nthe attack on the ground.\nAnd as an old man,\nZenji Abe came to a collection\nof Pearl Harbor survivors\nat a ceremony there\nand in halting English apologized\nfor what he had done as a young man.\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nNow, it doesn't always require decades.\nSometimes, extraordinary change\ncould happen in just hours.\nConsider the World War I\nChristmas truce of 1914.\nThe powers that be\nhad negotiated a brief truce\nso that soldiers could go out,\ncollect bodies from no-man's-land\nin between the trench lines.\nAnd soon British and German soldiers\nwere doing that,\nand then helping each other carry bodies,\nand then helping each other\ndig graves in the frozen ground,\nand then praying together,\nand then having Christmas together\nand exchanging gifts,\nand by the next day,\nthey were playing soccer together\nand exchanging addresses\nso they could meet after the war.\nThat truce kept going\nuntil the officers had to arrive\nand said, \"We will shoot you\nunless you go back\nto trying to kill each other.\"\nAnd all it took here was hours\nfor these men to develop\na completely new category of \"us,\"\nall of us in the trenches here\non both sides, dying for no damn reason,\nand who is a \"them,\"\nthose faceless powers behind the lines\nwho were using them as pawns.\n\n\n\n13:29\n\n\nAnd sometimes,\nchange can occur in seconds.\nProbably the most horrifying event\nin the Vietnam War\nwas the My Lai Massacre.\nA brigade of American soldiers\nwent into an undefended\nvillage full of civilians\nand killed between 350 and 500 of them,\nmass-raped women and children,\nmutilated bodies.\nIt was appalling.\nIt was appalling because it occurred,\nbecause the government denied it,\nbecause the US government eventually\ndid nothing more than a slap on the wrist,\nand appalling because it almost certainly\nwas not a singular event.\nThis man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man\nwho stopped the My Lai Massacre.\nHe was piloting a helicopter gunship,\nlanded there, got out\nand saw American soldiers shooting babies,\nshooting old women,\nfigured out what was going on,\nand he then took his helicopter\nand did something that undid\nhis lifetime of conditioning\nas to who is an \"us\" and who is a \"them.\"\nHe landed his helicopter\nin between some surviving villagers\nand American soldiers\nand he trained his machine guns\non his fellow Americans,\nand said, \"If you don't stop the

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nChris Anderson:\nElon, hey, welcome back to TED.\nIt's great to have you here.\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\nElon Musk: Thanks for having me.\n\n\n\n 0:17\n\n\nCA: So, in the next half hour or so,\nwe're going to spend some time\nexploring your vision for what\nan exciting future might look like,\nwhich I guess makes\nthe first question a little ironic:\nWhy are you boring?\n\n\n\n 0:32\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nI ask myself that frequently.\nWe're trying to dig a hole under LA,\nand this is to create the beginning\nof what will hopefully\nbe a 3D network of tunnels\nto alleviate congestion.\nSo right now, one of the most\nsoul-destroying things is traffic.\nIt affects people\nin every part of the world.\nIt takes away so much of your life.\nIt's horrible.\nIt's particularly horrible in LA.\n\n\n\n 1:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:11\n\n\nCA: I think you've brought with you\nthe first visualization\nthat's been shown of this.\nCan I show this?\n\n\n\n 1:17\n\n\nEM: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo this is the first time —\nJust to show what we're talking about.\nSo a couple of key things\nthat are important\nin having a 3D tunnel network.\nFirst of all, you have to be able\nto integrate the entrance\nand exit of the tunnel\nseamlessly into the fabric of the city.\nSo by having an elevator,\nsort of a car skate,\nthat's on an elevator,\nyou can integrate the entrance\nand exits to the tunnel network\njust by using two parking spaces.\nAnd then the car gets on a skate.\nThere's no speed limit here,\nso we're designing this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nCA: How much?\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nEM: 200 kilometers an hour,\nor about 130 miles per hour.\nSo you should be able\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX\nin six minutes — five, six minutes.\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nCA: So possibly, initially done,\nit's like on a sort\nof toll road-type basis.\n\n\n\n 2:20\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\nCA: Which, I guess,\nalleviates some traffic\nfrom the surface streets as well.\n\n\n\n 2:25\n\n\nEM: So, I don't know\nif people noticed it in the video,\nbut there's no real limit\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have.\nYou can go much further deep\nthan you can go up.\nThe deepest mines are much deeper\nthan the tallest buildings are tall,\nso you can alleviate any arbitrary\nlevel of urban congestion\nwith a 3D tunnel network.\nThis is a very important point.\nSo a key rebuttal to the tunnels\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels,\nthat will simply alleviate congestion,\nit will get used up,\nand then you'll be back where you started,\nback with congestion.\nBut you can go to any\narbitrary number of tunnels,\nany number of levels.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nCA: But people — seen traditionally,\nit's incredibly expensive to dig,\nand that would block this idea.\n\n\n\n 3:10\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nWell, they're right.\nTo give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension,\nwhich is — I think it's\na two-and-a-half mile extension\nthat was just completed\nfor two billion dollars.\nSo it's roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension in LA.\nAnd this is not the highest\nutility subway in the world.\nSo yeah, it's quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally.\nI think we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement\nin the cost per mile of tunneling.\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\nCA: And how could you achieve that?\n\n\n\n 3:47\n\n\nEM: Actually, if you just do two things,\nyou can get to approximately\nan order of magnitude improvement,\nand I think you can go beyond that.\nSo the first thing to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter\nby a factor of two or more.\nSo a single road lane tunnel\naccording to regulations\nhas to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter\nto allow for crashes\nand emergency vehicles\nand sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion engine cars.\nBut if you shrink that diameter\nto what we're attempting,\nwhich is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through,\nyou drop the diameter by a factor of two\nand the cross-sectional area\nby a factor of four,\nand the tunneling cost scales\nwith the cross-sectional area.\nSo that's roughly a half-order\nof magnitude improvement right there.\nThen tunneling machines currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop,\nand then the rest of the time\nis putting in reinforcements\nfor the tunnel wall.\nSo if you design the machine instead\nto do continuous\ntunneling and reinforcing,\nthat will give you\na factor of two improvement.\nCombine that and that's a factor of eight.\nAlso these machines are far from being\nat their power or thermal limits,\nso you can jack up the power\nto the machine substantially.\nI think you can get\nat least a factor of two,\nmaybe a factor of four or five\nimprovement on top of that.\nSo I think there's a fairly\nstraightforward series of steps\nto get somewhere in excess\nof an order of magnitude improvement\nin the cost per mile,\nand our target actually is —\nwe've got a pet snail called Gary,\nthis is from Gary the snail\nfrom \"South Park,\"\nI mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\"\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nSo Gary is capable of —\ncurrently he's capable\nof going 14 times faster\nthan a tunnel-boring machine.\n\n\n\n 5:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\nCA: You want to beat Gary.\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\nEM: We want to beat Gary.\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:48\n\n\nHe's not a patient little fellow,\nand that will be victory.\nVictory is beating the snail.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nCA: But a lot of people imagining,\ndreaming about future cities,\nthey imagine that actually\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.\nYou go aboveground.\nWhy isn't that a better solution?\nYou save all that tunneling cost.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nEM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.\nObviously, I do rockets,\nso I like things that fly.\nThis is not some inherent bias\nagainst flying things,\nbut there is a challenge with flying cars\nin that they'll be quite noisy,\nthe wind force generated\nwill be very high.\nLet's just say that if something's\nflying over your head,\na whole bunch of flying cars\ngoing all over the place,\nthat is not an anxiety-reducing situation.\n\n\n\n 6:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:44\n\n\nYou don't think to yourself,\n\"Well, I feel better about today.\"\nYou're thinking,\n\"Did they service their hubcap,\nor is it going to come off\nand guillotine me?\"\nThings like that.\n\n\n\n 6:59\n\n\nCA: So you've got this vision\nof future cities with these rich,\n3D networks of tunnels underneath.\nIs there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?\nCould you apply these tunnels\nto use for this Hyperloop idea\nyou released a few years ago.\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so we've been\nsort of puttering around\nwith the Hyperloop stuff for a while.\nWe built a Hyperloop test track\nadjacent to SpaceX,\njust for a student competition,\nto encourage innovative\nideas in transport.\nAnd it actually ends up being\nthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world\nafter the Large Hadron Collider,\nby volume.\nSo it was quite fun to do that,\nbut it was kind of a hobby thing,\nand then we think we might —\nso we've built a little pusher car\nto push the student pods,\nbut we're going to try seeing\nhow fast we can make the pusher go\nif it's not pushing something.\nSo we're cautiously optimistic\nwe'll be able to be faster\nthan the world's fastest bullet train\neven in a .8-mile stretch.\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nCA: Whoa. Good brakes.\n\n\n\n 8:13\n\n\nEM: Yeah, I mean, it's — yeah.\nIt's either going to smash\ninto tiny pieces or go quite fast.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nCA: But you can picture,\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel\nrunning quite long distances.\n\n\n\n 8:26\n\n\nEM: Exactly.\nAnd looking at tunneling technology,\nit turns out that\nin order to make a tunnel,\nyou have to —\nIn order to seal against the water table,\nyou've got to typically design\na tunnel wall to be good\nto about five or six atmospheres.\nSo to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,\nor near-vacuum.\nSo actually, it sort of turns out\nthat automatically,\nif you build a tunnel that is good enough\nto resist the water table,\nit is automatically\ncapable of holding vacuum.\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\nCA: Huh.\n\n\n\n 9:03\n\n\nEM: So, yeah.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nCA: And so you could actually picture,\nwhat kind of length tunnel\nis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nEM: I think there's no real length limit.\nYou could dig as much as you want.\nI think if you were to do something\nlike a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,\nI think you'd probably want\nto go underground the entire way\nbecause it's a high-density area.\nYou're going under\na lot of buildings and houses,\nand if you go deep enough,\nyou cannot detect the tunnel.\nSometimes people think,\nwell, it's going to be pretty annoying\nto have a tunnel dug under my house.\nLike, if that tunnel is dug\nmore than about three or four\ntunnel diameters beneath your house,\nyou will not be able\nto detect it being dug at all.\nIn fact, if you're able\nto detect the tunnel being dug,\nwhatever device you are using,\nyou can get a lot of money\nfor that device from the Israeli military,\nwho is trying to detect\ntunnels from Hamas,\nand from the US Customs and Border patrol\nthat try and detect drug tunnels.\nSo the reality is\nthat earth is incredibly good\nat absorbing vibrations,\nand once the tunnel depth\nis below a certain level,\nit is undetectable.\nMaybe if you have a very sensitive\nseismic instrument,\nyou might be able to detect it.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\nCA: So you've started\na new company to do this\ncalled The Boring Company.\nVery nice. Very funny.\n\n\n\n10:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:35\n\n\nEM: What's funny about that?\n\n\n\n10:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:39\n\n\nCA: How much of your time is this?\n\n\n\n10:42\n\n\nEM: It's maybe ...\ntwo or three percent.\n\n\n\n10:48\n\n\nCA: You've bought a hobby.\nThis is what an Elon Musk\nhobby looks like.\n\n\n\n10:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\nEM: I mean, it really is, like —\nThis is basically interns\nand people doing it part time.\nWe bought some second-hand machinery.\nIt's kind of puttering along,\nbut it's making good progress, so —\n\n\n\n11:11\n\n\nCA: So an even bigger part of your time\nis being spent on electrifying\ncars and transport through Tesla.\nIs one of the motivations\nfor the tunneling project\nthe realization that actually,\nin a world where cars are electric\nand where they're self-driving,\nthere may end up being\nmore cars on the roads\non any given hour than there are now?\n\n\n\n11:33\n\n\nEM: Yeah, exactly.\nA lot of people think\nthat when you make cars autonomous,\nthey'll be able to go faster\nand that will alleviate congestion.\nAnd to some degree that will be true,\nbut once you have shared autonomy\nwhere it's much cheaper to go by car\nand you can go point to point,\nthe affordability of going in a car\nwill be better than that of a bus.\nLike, it will cost less than a bus ticket.\nSo the amount of driving that will occur\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy,\nand actually traffic will get far worse.\n\n\n\n12:11\n\n\nCA: You started Tesla\nwith the goal of persuading the world\nthat electrification\nwas the future of cars,\nand a few years ago,\npeople were laughing at you.\nNow, not so much.\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nEM: OK.\n\n\n\n12:24\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:26\n\n\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\n\n\n12:29\n\n\nCA: But isn't it true that pretty much\nevery auto manufacturer\nhas announced\nserious electrification plans\nfor the short- to medium-term future?\n\n\n\n12:39\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Yeah.\nI think almost every automaker\nhas some electric vehicle program.\nThey vary in seriousness.\nSome are very serious\nabout transitioning entirely to electric,\nand some are just dabbling in it.\nAnd some, amazingly,\nare still pursuing fuel cells,\nbut I think that won't last much longer.\n\n\n\n13:00\n\n\nCA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,\nwhere you can now just declare victory\nand say, you know, \"We did it.\"\nLet the world electrify,\nand you go on and focus on other stuff?\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nI intend to stay with Tesla\nas far into the future as I can imagine,\nand there are a lot of exciting\nthings that we have coming.\nObviously the Model 3 is coming soon.\nWe'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.\n\n\n\n13:31\n\n\nCA: OK, we're going to come to this.\nSo Model 3, it's supposed\nto be coming in July-ish.\n\n\n\n13:38\n\n\nEM: Yeah, it's looking quite good\nfor starting production in July.\n\n\n\n13:42\n\n\nCA: Wow.\nOne of the things\nthat people are so excited about\nis the fact that it's got autopilot.\nAnd you put out this video a while back\nshowing what that technology\nwould look like.\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nThere's obviously autopilot\nin Model S right now.\nWhat are we seeing here?\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so this is using\nonly cameras and GPS.\nSo there's no LIDAR\nor radar being used here.\nThis is just using passive optical,\nwhich is essentially what a person uses.\nThe whole road system\nis meant to be navigated\nwith passive optical, or cameras,\nand so once you solve cameras\nor vision,\nthen autonomy is solved.\nIf you don't solve vision,\nit's not solved.\nSo that's why our focus is\nso heavily on having a vision neural net\nthat's very effective for road conditions.\n\n\n\n14:42\n\n\nCA: Right. Many other people\nare going the LIDAR route.\nYou want cameras plus radar is most of it.\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\nEM: You can absolutely\nbe superhuman with just cameras.\nLike, you can probably do it\nten times better than humans would,\njust cameras.\n\n\n\n14:55\n\n\nCA: So the new cars being sold right now\nhave eight cameras in them.\nThey can't yet do what that showed.\nWhen will they be able to?\n\n\n\n15:07\n\n\nEM: I think we're still on track\nfor being able to go cross-country\nfrom LA to New York by the end\nof the year, fully autonomous.\n\n\n\n15:17\n\n\nCA: OK, so by the end\nof the year, you're saying,\nsomeone's going to sit in a Tesla\nwithout touching the steering wheel,\ntap in \"New York,\" off it goes.\n\n\n\n15:27\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n15:28\n\n\nCA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel —\nby the end of 2017.\n\n\n\n15:33\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Essentially,\nNovember or December of this year,\nwe should be able to go all the way\nfrom a parking lot in California\nto a parking lot in New York,\nno controls touched at any point\nduring the entire journey.\n\n\n\n15:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:49\n\n\nCA: Amazing.\nBut part of that is possible\nbecause you've already got a fleet\nof Teslas driving all these roads.\nYou're accumulating a huge amount\nof data of that national road system.\n\n\n\n16:02\n\n\nEM: Yes, but the thing\nthat will be interesting\nis that I'm actually fairly confident\nit will be able to do that route\neven if you change the route dynamically.\nSo, it's fairly easy —\nIf you say I'm going to be really good\nat one specific route, that's one thing,\nbut it should be able to go,\nreally be very good,\ncertainly once you enter a highway,\nto go anywhere on the highway system\nin a given country.\nSo it's not sort of limited\nto LA to New York.\nWe could change it\nand make it Seattle-Florida,\nthat day, in real time.\nSo you were going from LA to New York.\nNow go from LA to Toronto.\n\n\n\n16:49\n\n\nCA: So leaving aside\nregulation for a second,\nin terms of the technology alone,\nthe time when someone\nwill be able to buy one of your cars\nand literally just take the hands\noff the wheel and go to sleep\nand wake up and find that they've arrived,\nhow far away is that, to do that safely?\n\n\n\n17:06\n\n\nEM: I think that's about two years.\nSo the real trick of it\nis not how do you make it work\nsay 99.9 percent of the time,\nbecause, like, if a car crashes\none in a thousand times,\nthen you're probably still not going\nto be comfortable falling asleep.\nYou shouldn't be, certainly.\n\n\n\n17:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n17:31\n\n\nIt's never going to be perfect.\nNo system is going to be perfect,\nbut if you say it's perhaps —\nthe car is unlikely to crash\nin a hundred lifetimes,\nor a thousand lifetimes,\nthen people are like, OK, wow,\nif I were to live a thousand lives,\nI would still most likely\nnever experience a crash,\nthen that's probably OK.\n\n\n\n17:53\n\n\nCA: To sleep.\nI guess the big concern of yours\nis that people may actually\nget seduced too early\nto think that this is safe,\nand that you'll have some horrible\nincident happen that puts things back.\n\n\n\n18:04\n\n\nEM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash,\nexcept in rare circumstances.\nThe thing to appreciate\nabout vehicle safety\nis this is probabilistic.\nI mean, there's some chance that any time\na human driver gets in a car,\nthat they will have an accident\nthat is their fault.\nIt's never zero.\nSo really the key threshold for autonomy\nis how much better does autonomy\nneed to be than a person\nbefore you can rely on it?\n\n\n\n18:38\n\n\nCA: But once you get\nliterally safe hands-off driving,\nthe power to disrupt\nthe whole industry seems massive,\nbecause at that point you've spoken\nof people being able to buy a car,\ndrops you off at work,\nand then you let it go\nand provide a sort of Uber-like\nservice to other people,\nearn you money,\nmaybe even cover the cost\nof your lease of that car,\nso you can kind of get a car for free.\nIs that really likely?\n\n\n\n19:02\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Absolutely\nthis is what will happen.\nSo there will be a shared autonomy fleet\nwhere you buy your car\nand you can choose\nto use that car exclusively,\nyou could choose to have it be used\nonly by friends and family,\nonly by other drivers\nwho are rated five star,\nyou can choose to share it sometimes\nbut not other times.\nThat's 100 percent what will occur.\nIt's just a question of when.\n\n\n\n19:32\n\n\nCA: Wow.\nSo you mentioned the Semi\nand I think you're planning\nto announce this in September,\nbut I'm curious whether there's\nanything you could show us today?\n\n\n\n19:42\n\n\nEM: I will show you\na teaser shot of the truck.\n\n\n\n19:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:48\n\n\nIt's alive.\n\n\n\n19:50\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n19:51\n\n\nEM: That's definitely a case\nwhere we want to be cautious\nabout the autonomy features.\nYeah.\n\n\n\n19:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n20:00\n\n\nCA: We can't see that much of it,\nbut it doesn't look like\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck.\nIt looks kind of badass.\nWhat sort of semi is this?\n\n\n\n20:10\n\n\nEM: So this is a heavy duty,\nlong-range semitruck.\nSo it's the highest weight capability\nand with long range.\nSo essentially it's meant to alleviate\nthe heavy-duty trucking loads.\nAnd this is something which\npeople do not today think is possible.\nThey think the truck doesn't have enough\npower or it doesn't have enough range,\nand then with the Tesla Semi\nwe want to show that no, an electric truck\nactually can out-torque any diesel semi.\nAnd if you had a tug-of-war competition,\nthe Tesla Semi\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill.\n\n\n\n20:57\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n21:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n21:02\n\n\nCA: That's pretty cool.\nAnd short term, these aren't driverless.\nThese are going to be trucks\nthat truck drivers want to drive.\n\n\n\n21:09\n\n\nEM: Yes. So what will be\nreally fun about this\nis you have a flat torque RPM curve\nwith an electric motor,\nwhereas with a diesel motor or any kind\nof internal combustion engine car,\nyou've got a torque RPM curve\nthat looks like a hill.\nSo this will be a very spry truck.\nYou can drive this\naround like a sports car.\nThere's no gears.\nIt's, like, single speed.\n\n\n\n21:33\n\n\nCA: There's a great movie\nto be made here somewhere.\nI don't know what it is\nand I don't know that it ends well,\nbut it's a great movie.\n\n\n\n21:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n21:40\n\n\nEM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.\nWhen I was driving the test prototype\nfor the first truck.\nIt's really weird,\nbecause you're driving around\nand you're just so nimble,\nand you're in this giant truck.\n\n\n\n21:52\n\n\nCA: Wait, you've\nalready driven a prototype?\n\n\n\n21:56\n\n\nEM: Yeah, I drove it\naround the parking lot,\nand I was like, this is crazy.\n\n\n\n21:59\n\n\nCA: Wow. This is no vaporware.\n\n\n\n22:02\n\n\nEM: It's just like,\ndriving this giant truck\nand making these mad maneuvers.\n\n\n\n22:06\n\n\nCA: This is cool.\nOK, from a really badass picture\nto a kind of less badass picture.\nThis is just a cute house\nfrom \"Desperate Housewives\" or something.\nWhat on earth is going on here?\n\n\n\n22:17\n\n\nEM: Well, this illustrates\nthe picture of the future\nthat I think is how things will evolve.\nYou've got an electric car\nin the driveway.\nIf you look in between\nthe electric car and the house,\nthere are actually three Powerwalls\nstacked up against the side of the house,\nand then that house roof is a solar roof.\nSo that's an actual solar glass roof.\n\n\n\n22:38\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n22:39\n\n\nEM: That's a picture of a real —\nwell, admittedly, it's a real fake house.\nThat's a real fake house.\n\n\n\n22:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n22:48\n\n\nCA: So these roof tiles,\nsome of them have in them\nbasically solar power, the ability to —\n\n\n\n22:56\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles\nwhere you can adjust\nthe texture and the color\nto a very fine-grained level,\nand then there's\nsort of microlouvers in the glass,\nsuch that when you're looking\nat the roof from street level\nor close to street level,\nall the tiles look the same\nwhether there is a solar cell\nbehind it or not.\nSo you have an even color\nfrom the ground level.\nIf you were to look at it\nfrom a helicopter,\nyou would be actually able\nto look through and see\nthat some of the glass tiles have\na solar cell behind them and some do not.\nYou can't tell from street level.\n\n\n\n23:42\n\n\nCA: You put them in the ones\nthat are likely to see a lot of sun,\nand that makes these roofs\nsuper affordable, right?\nThey're not that much more expensive\nthan just tiling the roof.\n\n\n\n23:50\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nWe're very confident\nthat the cost of the roof\nplus the cost of electricity —\nA solar glass roof will be less\nthan the cost of a normal roof\nplus the cost of electricity.\nSo in other words,\nthis will be economically a no-brainer,\nwe think it will look great,\nand it will last —\nWe thought about having\nthe warranty be infinity,\nbut then people thought,\nwell, that might sound\nlike were just talking rubbish,\nbut actually this is toughened glass.\nWell after the house has collapsed\nand there's nothing there,\nthe glass tiles will still be there.\n\n\n\n24:35\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n24:37\n\n\nCA: I mean, this is cool.\nSo you're rolling this out\nin a couple week's time, I think,\nwith four different roofing types.\n\n\n\n24:44\n\n\nEM: Yeah, we're starting off\nwith two, two initially,\nand the second two\nwill be introduced early next year.\n\n\n\n24:50\n\n\nCA: And what's the scale of ambition here?\nHow many houses do you believe\ncould end up having this type of roofing?\n\n\n\n24:58\n\n\nEM: I think eventually\nalmost all houses will have a solar roof.\nThe thing is to consider\nthe time scale here\nto be probably on the order\nof 40 or 50 years.\nSo on average, a roof\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years.\nBut you don't start replacing\nall roofs immediately.\nBut eventually,\nif you say were to fast-forward\nto say 15 years from now,\nit will be unusual to have a roof\nthat does not have solar.\n\n\n\n25:36\n\n\nCA: Is there a mental model thing\nthat people don't get here\nthat because of the shift in the cost,\nthe economics of solar power,\nmost houses actually have\nenough sunlight on their roof\npretty much to power all of their needs.\nIf you could capture the power,\nit could pretty much\npower all their needs.\nYou could go off-grid, kind of.\n\n\n\n25:55\n\n\nEM: It depends on where you are\nand what the house size is\nrelative to the roof area,\nbut it's a fair statement to say\nthat most houses in the US\nhave enough roof area\nto power all the needs of the house.\n\n\n\n26:10\n\n\nCA: So the key to the economics\nof the cars, the Semi, of these houses\nis the falling price\nof lithium-ion batteries,\nwhich you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.\nIn many ways, that's almost\nthe core competency.\nAnd you've decided\nthat to really, like, own that competency,\nyou just have to build\nthe world's largest manufacturing plant\nto double the world's supply\nof lithium-ion batteries,\nwith this guy. What is this?\n\n\n\n26:43\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,\nprogress so far on the Gigafactory.\nEventually, you can sort of roughly see\nthat there's sort of\na diamond shape overall,\nand when it's fully done,\nit'll look like a giant diamond,\nor that's the idea behind it,\nand it's aligned on true north.\nIt's a small detail.\n\n\n\n27:04\n\n\nCA: And capable of producing, eventually,\nlike a hundred gigawatt hours\nof batteries a year.\n\n\n\n27:11\n\n\nEM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\nWe think probably more, but yeah.\n\n\n\n27:14\n\n\nCA: And they're actually\nbeing produced right now.\n\n\n\n27:17\n\n\nEM: They're in production already.\nCA: You guys put out this video.\nI mean, is that speeded up?\n\n\n\n27:21\n\n\nEM: That's the slowed down version.\n\n\n\n27:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n27:25\n\n\nCA: How fast does it actually go?\n\n\n\n27:27\n\n\nEM: Well, when it's running at full speed,\nyou can't actually see the cells\nwithout a strobe light.\nIt's just blur.\n\n\n\n27:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n27:39\n\n\nCA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\nabout what makes an exciting future\nis a future where we no longer\nfeel guilty about energy.\nHelp us picture this.\nHow many Gigafactories, if you like,\ndoes it take to get us there?\n\n\n\n27:52\n\n\nEM: It's about a hundred, roughly.\nIt's not 10, it's not a thousand.\nMost likely a hundred.\n\n\n\n27:59\n\n\nCA: See, I find this amazing.\nYou can picture what it would take\nto move the world\noff this vast fossil fuel thing.\nIt's like you're building one,\nit costs five billion dollars,\nor whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.\nLike, it's kind of cool\nthat you can picture that project.\nAnd you're planning to do, at Tesla —\nannounce another two this year.\n\n\n\n28:24\n\n\nEM: I think we'll announce locations\nfor somewhere between two\nand four Gigafactories later this year.\nYeah, probably four.\n\n\n\n28:33\n\n\nCA: Whoa.\n\n\n\n28:34\n\n\n(Applause)\nNo more teasing from you for here?\nLike — where, continent?\nYou can say no.\n\n\n\n28:48\n\n\nEM: We need to address a global market.\n\n\n\n28:52\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n28:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n28:54\n\n\nThis is cool.\nI think we should talk for —\nActually, double mark it.\nI'm going to ask you one question\nabout politics, only one.\nI'm kind of sick of politics,\nbut I do want to ask you this.\nYou're on a body now\ngiving advice to a guy —\n\n\n\n29:18\n\n\nEM: Who?\n\n\n\n29:20\n\n\nCA: Who has said he doesn't\nreally believe in climate change,\nand there's a lot of people out there\nwho think you shouldn't be doing that.\nThey'd like you to walk away from that.\nWhat would you say to them?\n\n\n\n29:31\n\n\nEM: Well, I think that first of all,\nI'm just on two advisory councils\nwhere the format consists\nof going around the room\nand asking people's opinion on things,\nand so there's like a meeting\nevery month or two.\nThat's the sum total of my contribution.\nBut I think to the degree\nthat there are people in the room\nwho are arguing in favor\nof doing something about climate change,\nor social issues,\nI've used the meetings I've had thus far\nto argue in favor of immigration\nand in favor of climate change.\n\n\n\n30:13\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n30:15\n\n\nAnd if I hadn't done that,\nthat wasn't on the agenda before.\nSo maybe nothing will happen,\nbut at least the words were said.\n\n\n\n30:25\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n30:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n30:30\n\n\nSo let's talk SpaceX and Mars.\nLast time you were here,\nyou spoke about what seemed like\na kind of incredibly ambitious dream\nto develop rockets\nthat were actually reusable.\nAnd you've only gone and done it.\n\n\n\n30:46\n\n\nEM: Finally. It took a long time.\n\n\n\n30:47\n\n\nCA: Talk us through this.\nWhat are we looking at here?\n\n\n\n30:50\n\n\nEM: So this is one of our rocket boosters\ncoming back from\nvery high and fast in space.\nSo just delivered the upper stage\nat high velocity.\nI think this might have been\nat sort of Mach 7 or so,\ndelivery of the upper stage.\n\n\n\n31:09\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n31:12\n\n\nCA: So that was a sped-up —\n\n\n\n31:14\n\n\nEM: That was the slowed down version.\n\n\n\n31:16\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n31:17\n\n\nCA: I thought that was\nthe sped-up version.\nBut I mean, that's amazing,\nand several of these failed\nbefore you finally\nfigured out how to do it,\nbut now you've done this,\nwhat, five or six times?\n\n\n\n31:28\n\n\nEM: We're at eight or nine.\n\n\n\n31:31\n\n\nCA: And for the first time,\nyou've actually reflown\none of the rockets that landed.\n\n\n\n31:35\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster\nand then prepped it for flight again\nand flew it again,\nso it's the first reflight\nof an orbital booster\nwhere that reflight is relevant.\nSo it's important to appreciate\nthat reusability is only relevant\nif it is rapid and complete.\nSo like an aircraft or a car,\nthe reusability is rapid and complete.\nYou do not send your aircraft\nto Boeing in-between flights.\n\n\n\n32:07\n\n\nCA: Right. So this is allowing you\nto dream of this really ambitious idea\nof sending many, many, many people to Mars\nin, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.\n\n\n\n32:17\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n32:19\n\n\nCA: And you've designed\nthis outrageous rocket to do it.\nHelp us understand\nthe scale of this thing.\n\n\n\n32:24\n\n\nEM: Well, visually\nyou can see that's a person.\nYeah, and that's the vehicle.\n\n\n\n32:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n32:35\n\n\nCA: So if that was a skyscraper,\nthat's like, did I read that,\na 40-story skyscraper?\n\n\n\n32:40\n\n\nEM: Probably a little more, yeah.\nThe thrust level of this is really —\nThis configuration is about four times\nthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.\n\n\n\n32:55\n\n\nCA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\nrocket humanity ever created before.\n\n\n\n33:00\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\n\n33:03\n\n\nCA: As one does.\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n33:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n33:08\n\n\nIn units of 747, a 747 is only about\na quarter of a million pounds of thrust,\nso for every 10 million pounds of thrust,\nthere's 40 747s.\nSo this would be the thrust equivalent\nof 120 747s, with all engines blazing.\n\n\n\n33:25\n\n\nCA: And so even with a machine\ndesigned to escape Earth's gravity,\nI think you told me last time\nthis thing could actually\ntake a fully loaded 747,\npeople, cargo, everything,\ninto orbit.\n\n\n\n33:37\n\n\nEM: Exactly. This can take\na fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,\nmaximum passengers,\nmaximum cargo on the 747 —\nthis can take it as cargo.\n\n\n\n33:51\n\n\nCA: So based on this,\nyou presented recently\nthis Interplanetary Transport System\nwhich is visualized this way.\nThis is a scene you picture in, what,\n30 years time? 20 years time?\nPeople walking into this rocket.\n\n\n\n34:08\n\n\nEM: I'm hopeful it's sort of\nan eight- to 10-year time frame.\nAspirationally, that's our target.\nOur internal targets\nare more aggressive, but I think —\n\n\n\n34:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n34:22\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n34:23\n\n\nEM: While vehicle seems quite large\nand is large by comparison\nwith other rockets,\nI think the future spacecraft\nwill make this look like a rowboat.\nThe future spaceships\nwill be truly enormous.\n\n\n\n34:42\n\n\nCA: Why, Elon?\nWhy do we need to build a city on Mars\nwith a million people\non it in your lifetime,\nwhich I think is kind of\nwhat you've said you'd love to do?\n\n\n\n34:55\n\n\nEM: I think it's important to have\na future that is inspiring and appealing.\nI just think there have to be reasons\nthat you get up in the morning\nand you want to live.\nLike, why do you want to live?\nWhat's the point? What inspires you?\nWhat do you love about the future?\nAnd if we're not out there,\nif the future does not include\nbeing out there among the stars\nand being a multiplanet species,\nI find that it's incredibly depressing\nif that's not the future\nthat we're going to have.\n\n\n\n35:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n35:31\n\n\nCA: People want to position this\nas an either or,\nthat there are so many desperate things\nhappening on the planet now\nfrom climate to poverty\nto, you know, you pick your issue.\nAnd this feels like a distraction.\nYou shouldn't be thinking about this.\nYou should be solving what's here and now.\nAnd to be fair, you've done\na fair old bit to actually do that\nwith your work on sustainable energy.\nBut why not just do that?\n\n\n\n35:58\n\n\nEM: I think there's —\nI look at the future\nfrom the standpoint of probabilities.\nIt's like a branching\nstream of probabilities,\nand there are actions that we can take\nthat affect those probabilities\nor that accelerate one thing\nor slow down another thing.\nI may introduce something new\nto the probability stream.\nSustainable energy\nwill happen no matter what.\nIf there was no Tesla,\nif Tesla never existed,\nit would have to happen out of necessity.\nIt's tautological.\nIf you don't have sustainable energy,\nit means you have unsustainable energy.\nEventually you will run out,\nand the laws of economics\nwill drive civilization\ntowards sustainable energy,\ninevitably.\nThe fundamental value\nof a company like Tesla\nis the degree to which it accelerates\nthe advent of sustainable energy,\nfaster than it would otherwise occur.\n\n\n\n37:04\n\n\nSo when I think, like,\nwhat is the fundamental good\nof a company like Tesla,\nI would say, hopefully,\nif it accelerated that by a decade,\npotentially more than a decade,\nthat would be quite a good thing to occur.\nThat's what I consider to be\nthe fundamental\naspirational good of Tesla.\n\n\n\n37:24\n\n\nThen there's becoming a multiplanet\nspecies and space-faring civilization.\nThis is not inevitable.\nIt's very important to appreciate\nthis is not inevitable.\nThe sustainable energy future\nI think is largely inevitable,\nbut being a space-faring civilization\nis definitely not inevitable.\nIf you look at the progress in space,\nin 1969 you were able\nto send somebody to the moon.\n1969.\nThen we had the Space Shuttle.\nThe Space Shuttle could only\ntake people to low Earth orbit.\nThen the Space Shuttle retired,\nand the United States\ncould take no one to orbit.\nSo that's the trend.\nThe trend is like down to nothing.\nPeople are mistaken when they think\nthat technology\njust automatically improves.\nIt does not automatically improve.\nIt only improves if a lot of people\nwork very hard to make it better,\nand actually it will, I think,\nby itself degrade, actually.\nYou look at great civilizations\nlike Ancient Egypt,\nand they were able to make the pyramids,\nand they forgot how to do that.\nAnd then the Romans,\nthey built these incredible aqueducts.\nThey forgot how to do it.\n\n\n\n38:39\n\n\nCA: Elon, it almost seems,\nlistening to you\nand looking at the different\nthings you've done,\nthat you've got this unique\ndouble motivation on everything\nthat I find so interesting.\nOne is this desire to work\nfor humanity's long-term good.\nThe other is the desire\nto do something exciting.\nAnd often it feels like you feel\nlike you need the one to drive the other.\nWith Tesla, you want\nto have sustainable energy,\nso you made these super sexy,\nexciting cars to do it.\nSolar energy, we need to get there,\nso we need to make these beautiful roofs.\nWe haven't even spoken\nabout your newest thing,\nwhich we don't have time to do,\nbut you want to save humanity from bad AI,\nand so you're going to create\nthis really cool brain-machine interface\nto give us all infinite memory\nand telepathy and so forth.\nAnd on Mars, it feels\nlike what you're saying is,\nyeah, we need to save humanity\nand have a backup plan,\nbut also we need to inspire humanity,\nand this is a way to inspire.\n\n\n\n39:44\n\n\nEM: I think the value\nof beauty and inspiration\nis very much underrated,\nno question.\nBut I want to be clear.\nI'm not trying to be anyone's savior.\nThat is not the —\nI'm just trying to think about the future\nand not be sad.\n\n\n\n40:03\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n40:05\n\n\nCA: Beautiful statement.\nI think everyone here would agree\nthat it is not —\nNone of this is going\nto happen inevitably.\nThe fact that in your mind,\nyou dream this stuff,\nyou dream stuff that no one else\nwould dare dream,\nor no one else\nwould be capable of dreaming\nat the level of complexity that you do.\nThe fact that you do that, Elon Musk,\nis a really remarkable thing.\nThank you for helping us all\nto dream a bit bigger.\n\n\n\n40:33\n\n\nEM: But you'll tell me if it ever\nstarts getting genuinely insane, right?\n\n\n\n40:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n40:39\n\n\nCA: Thank you, Elon Musk.\nThat was really, really fantastic.\nThat was really fantastic.\n\n\n\n40:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI have a two-year-old daughter named Naya\nwho is under the mistaken impression\nthat this conference\nis named in honor of her father.\n\n\n\n 0:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:21\n\n\nWho am I to contradict my baby girl?\n\n\n\n 0:24\n\n\nAs many of you know, there's something\nabout becoming a parent\nthat concentrates the mind\non long-term problems like climate change.\nIt was the birth of my daughter\nthat inspired me\nto launch this climate organization,\nin order to counteract the excessive\npolarization of this issue\nin the United States,\nand to find a conservative\npathway forward.\nYes, folks, a Republican\nclimate solution is possible,\nand you know what?\nIt may even be better.\n\n\n\n 0:57\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:59\n\n\nLet me try to prove that to you.\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nWhat we really need\nis a killer app to climate policy.\nIn the technology world, a killer app\nis an application so transformative\nthat it creates its own market,\nlike Uber.\nIn the climate world,\na killer app is a new\nsolution so promising\nthat it can break through\nthe seemingly insurmountable\nbarriers to progress.\nThese include the psychological barrier.\nClimate advocates have long\nbeen encouraging their fellow citizens\nto make short-term sacrifices now\nfor benefits that accrue to other people\nin other countries 30 or 40\nyears in the future.\nIt just doesn't fly because it runs\ncontrary to basic human nature.\n\n\n\n 1:45\n\n\nNext is the geopolitical barrier.\nUnder the current rules of global trade,\ncountries have a strong incentive\nto free ride off the emissions reductions\nof other nations,\ninstead of strengthening\ntheir own programs.\nThis has been the curse\nof every international\nclimate negotiations, including Paris.\nFinally, we have the partisan barrier.\nEven the most committed countries —\nGermany, the United Kingdom, Canada —\nare nowhere near reducing emissions\nat the required scale and speed.\nNot even close.\nAnd the partisan climate divide\nis far more acute\nhere in the United States.\nWe are fundamentally stuck,\nand that is why we need\na killer app of climate policy\nto break through each of these barriers.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nI'm convinced that the road\nto climate progress in the United States\nruns through the Republican Party\nand the business community.\nSo in launching\nthe Climate Leadership Council,\nI started by reaching out to a who's who\nof Republican elder statesmen\nand business leaders,\nincluding James Baker and George Schultz,\nthe two most respected Republican\nelder statesmen in America;\nMartin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,\nthe two most respected\nconservative economists in the country;\nand Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,\ntwo of the most successful\nand admired business leaders.\nTogether, we co-authored\n\"The Conservative Case\nFor Carbon Dividends.\"\nThis represents the first time\nthat Republican leaders put forth\na concrete market-based climate solution.\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 3:28\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 3:30\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 3:32\n\n\nWe presented our plan at the White House\ntwo weeks after President Trump moved in.\nAlmost every leading\neditorial board in the country\nhas since endorsed our plan,\nand Fortune 100 companies\nfrom a wide range of industries\nare now getting behind it.\nSo by now you're probably wondering,\nwhat exactly is this plan?\n\n\n\n 3:56\n\n\nWell, our carbon dividends solution\nis based on four pillars.\nThe first is a gradually\nrising carbon tax.\nAlthough capitalism is a wonderful system,\nlike many operating systems,\nit's prone to bugs,\nwhich, in this case, are called\n\"market failures.\"\nBy far the largest is that\nmarket prices fail to take\nsocial and environmental\ncosts into account.\nThat means every market transaction\nis based on incorrect information.\nThis fundamental bug of capitalism,\nmore than any other single factor,\nis to blame for our climate predicament.\n\n\n\n 4:33\n\n\nNow in theory, this should be\nan easy problem to fix.\nEconomists agree\nthat the best solution is to put a price\non the carbon content of fossil fuels,\notherwise known as a carbon tax.\nThis would discourage carbon emissions\nin every single economic transaction,\nevery day of the year.\nHowever, a carbon tax by itself\nhas proven to be unpopular\nand a political dead end.\nThe answer is to return\nall the money raised\ndirectly to citizens,\nin the form of equal monthly dividends.\nThis would transform\nan unpopular carbon tax\ninto a popular and populist solution,\nand it would also solve\nthe underlying psychological barrier\nthat we discussed,\nby giving everyone a concrete benefit\nin the here and now.\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nAnd these benefits would be significant.\nAssuming a carbon tax rate\nthat starts at 40 dollars per ton,\na family of four would receive\n2,000 dollars per year\nfrom the get-go.\nAccording to the US Treasury Department,\nthe bottom 70 percent of Americans\nwould receive more in dividends\nthan they would pay\nin increased energy prices.\nThat means 223 million Americans\nwould win economically\nfrom solving climate change.\nAnd that —\n\n\n\n 6:01\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:03\n\n\nis revolutionary,\nand could fundamentally\nalter climate politics.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nBut there's another\nrevolutionary element here.\nThe amount of the dividend would grow\nas the carbon tax rate increases.\nThe more we protect our climate,\nthe more our citizens benefit.\nThis creates a positive feedback loop,\nwhich is crucial,\nbecause the only way we will reach\nour long-term emission-reduction goals\nis if the carbon tax rate\ngoes up every year.\n\n\n\n 6:33\n\n\nThe third pillar of our program\nis eliminating regulations\nthat are no longer needed\nonce a carbon dividends plan is enacted.\nThis is a key selling point\nto Republicans and business leaders.\nSo why should we trade\nclimate regulations for a price on carbon?\nWell, let me show you.\nOur plan would achieve nearly twice\nthe emissions reductions\nof all Obama-era climate\nregulations combined,\nand nearly three times the new baseline\nafter President Trump repeals\nall of those regulations.\nThat assumes a carbon tax\nstarting at 40 dollars per ton,\nwhich translates into roughly\nan extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.\nOur plan by itself\nwould meet the high end\nof America's commitment\nunder the Paris Climate Agreement,\nand as you can see,\nthe emissions reductions\nwould continue over time.\nThis illustrates the power\nof a conservative climate solution\nbased on free markets\nand limited government.\nWe would end up with less regulation\nand far less pollution at the same time,\nwhile helping working-class\nAmericans get ahead.\nDoesn't that sound like something\nwe could all support?\n\n\n\n 7:58\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nThe fourth and final pillar of our program\nis a new climate domino effect,\nbased on border carbon adjustments.\nNow that may sound complicated,\nbut it, too, is revolutionary,\nbecause it provides us\na whole new strategy\nto reach a global price on carbon,\nwhich is ultimately what we need.\nLet me show you an example.\nSuppose Country A adopts\na carbon dividends plan,\nand Country B does not.\nWell, to level the playing field\nand protect the competitiveness\nof its industries,\nCountry A would tax imports from Country B\nbased on their carbon content.\nFair enough.\nBut here's where it gets\nreally interesting,\nbecause the money raised at the border\nwould increase the dividends\ngoing to the citizens of Country A.\nWell, how long do you think it would take\nthe public in Country B to realize\nthat that money should be going to them,\nand to push for a carbon\ndividends plan in their own land?\nAdd a few more countries,\nand we get a new climate domino effect.\n\n\n\n 9:06\n\n\nOnce one major country or region\nadopts carbon dividends\nwith border carbon adjustments,\nother countries are compelled\nto follow suit.\nOne by one the dominoes fall.\nAnd this domino effect\ncould start anywhere.\nMy preference, strongly,\nis the United States,\nbut it could also start\nin the United Kingdom,\nin Germany or another European country,\nor even in China.\n\n\n\n 9:31\n\n\nLet's take China as an example.\nChina is committed to reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\nbut what its leaders care even more about\nis transitioning their economy\nto consumer-led economic development.\nWell, nothing could do more\nto hasten that transition\nthan giving every Chinese citizen\na monthly dividend.\nIn fact, this is the only policy solution\nthat would enable China to meet\nits environmental and economic goals\nat the same time.\n\n\n\n 9:59\n\n\nThat's why this is the killer app\nof climate policy,\nbecause it would enable us to overcome\neach of the barriers we discussed earlier:\nthe psychological barrier,\nthe partisan barrier,\nand, as we've just seen,\nthe geopolitical barrier.\nAll we need is a country to lead the way.\nAnd one method of finding\nwhat you're looking for\nis to take out an ad.\nSo let's read this one together.\n\n\n\n10:25\n\n\nWanted: country to pioneer\ncarbon dividends plan.\nCost to country: zero.\nStarting date: as soon as possible.\nAdvantages: most effective\nclimate solution,\npopular and populist,\npro-growth and pro-business,\nshrinks government\nand helps the working class.\nAdditional compensation: gratitude\nof current and future generations,\nincluding my daughter.\n\n\n\n10:55\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n10:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:03\n\n\nChris Anderson: Just one\nquestion for you, Ted.\nI'm actually not sure\nI've seen a conservative\nget a standing O at TED before that.\nThat's pretty cool.\nThe logic seems really powerful,\nbut some people you talk to in politics\nsay it's hard to imagine this\nstill getting through Congress.\nHow are you feeling\nabout momentum behind this?\n\n\n\n11:25\n\n\nTed Halstead: So I understand\nthat many are very pessimistic\nabout what's happening in\nthe United States with President Trump.\nI'm less pessimistic; here's why.\nThe actions of this White House,\nthe early actions on climate,\nare just the first move\nin a complex game of climate chess.\nSo far it's been a repeal-only strategy;\nthe pressure is going to mount \nfor a replacement program,\nwhich is where we come in.\nAnd there are three reasons why,\nwhich I'll go through real quickly.\n\n\n\n11:52\n\n\nOne, the business community\nis fundamentally parting ways\nwith the White House on climate change.\nIn fact, we're finding\na number of Fortune 100 companies\nsupporting our program.\nWithin two months,\nwe're going to be announcing\nsome really surprising names\ncoming out in favor of this program.\nTwo, there is no issue\nin American politics\nwhere there's a more fundamental gap\nbetween the Republican base\nand the Republican leadership\nthan climate change.\nAnd three, thinking of\nthis analogy of chess,\nthe big decision up ahead is:\nDoes the administration stay in Paris?\nWell, let's pan it out both ways.\nIf it stays in Paris, as many\nare pushing for in the administration,\nwell then that begs a question:\nWhat's the plan?\nWe have the plan.\nBut if they don't stay in Paris,\nthe international pressure\nwill be overwhelming.\nOur Secretary of State will be asking\nother countries for NATO contributions,\nand they'll be saying,\n\"No, give us our Paris commitment.\nCome through on your commitments,\nwe'll come through on ours.\"\n\n\n\n12:50\n\n\nSo, international, business\nand even the Republican base\nwill all be calling for\na Republican replacement plan.\nAnd, hopefully, we've provided one.\n\n\n\n13:00\n\n\nCA: Thank you so much, Ted.\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\nTH: Thank you, Chris.\n\n\n\n13:03\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIt's six o'clock in the morning,\npitch black outside.\nMy 14-year-old son\nis fast asleep in his bed,\nsleeping the reckless,\ndeep sleep of a teenager.\nI flip on the light and physically\nshake the poor boy awake,\nbecause I know that,\nlike ripping off a Band-Aid,\nit's better to get it over with quickly.\n\n\n\n 0:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:33\n\n\nI have a friend who yells \"Fire!\"\njust to rouse her sleeping teen.\nAnd another who got so fed up\nthat she had to dump cold water\non her son's head\njust to get him out of bed.\nSound brutal ...\nbut perhaps familiar?\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nEvery morning I ask myself,\n\"How can I —\nknowing what I know\nand doing what I do for a living —\nbe doing this to my own son?\"\nYou see,\nI'm a sleep researcher.\n\n\n\n 1:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nSo I know far too much about sleep\nand the consequences of sleep loss.\nI know that I'm depriving my son\nof the sleep he desperately needs\nas a rapidly growing teenager.\nI also know that by waking him up\nhours before his natural\nbiological clock tells him he's ready,\nI'm literally robbing him\nof his dreams —\nthe type of sleep most associated\nwith learning, memory consolidation\nand emotional processing.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nBut it's not just my kid\nthat's being deprived of sleep.\nSleep deprivation among\nAmerican teenagers is an epidemic.\nOnly about one in 10 gets\nthe eight to 10 hours of sleep per night\nrecommended by sleep scientists\nand pediatricians.\nNow, if you're thinking to yourself,\n\"Phew, we're doing good,\nmy kid's getting eight hours,\"\nremember,\neight hours is\nthe minimum recommendation.\nYou're barely passing.\nEight hours is kind of like\ngetting a C on your report card.\n\n\n\n 2:09\n\n\nThere are many factors\ncontributing to this epidemic,\nbut a major factor preventing teens\nfrom getting the sleep they need\nis actually a matter of public policy.\nNot hormones, social lives or Snapchat.\nAcross the country,\nmany schools are starting\naround 7:30am or earlier,\ndespite the fact that major\nmedical organizations recommend\nthat middle and high school\nstart no earlier than 8:30am.\nThese early start policies\nhave a direct effect on how much —\nor really how little sleep\nAmerican teenagers are getting.\n\n\n\n 2:51\n\n\nThey're also pitting\nteenagers and their parents\nin a fundamentally unwinnable fight\nagainst their own bodies.\nAround the time of puberty,\nteenagers experience a delay\nin their biological clock,\nwhich determines when we feel most awake\nand when we feel most sleepy.\nThis is driven in part by a shift\nin the release of the hormone melatonin.\nTeenagers' bodies wait to start releasing\nmelatonin until around 11pm,\nwhich is two hours later than what\nwe see in adults or younger children.\nThis means that waking a teenager up\nat 6am is the biological equivalent\nof waking an adult up at 4am.\nOn the unfortunate days\nwhen I have to wake up at 4am,\nI'm a zombie.\nFunctionally useless.\nI can't think straight,\nI'm irritable,\nand I probably shouldn't be driving a car.\nBut this is how many American\nteenagers feel every single school day.\nIn fact, many of the, shall we say,\nunpleasant characteristics\nthat we chalk up to being a teenager —\nmoodiness, irritability,\nlaziness, depression —\ncould be a product\nof chronic sleep deprivation.\nFor many teens\nbattling chronic sleep loss,\ntheir go-to strategy to compensate\nis consuming large quantities of caffeine\nin the form of venti frappuccinos,\nor energy drinks and shots.\nSo essentially,\nwe've got an entire population\nof tired but wired youth.\n\n\n\n 4:32\n\n\nAdvocates of sleep-friendly\nstart times know\nthat adolescence is a period\nof dramatic brain development,\nparticularly in the parts of the brain\nthat are responsible for those\nhigher order thinking processes,\nincluding reasoning, problem-solving\nand good judgment.\nIn other words, the very type\nof brain activity that's responsible\nfor reining in those impulsive\nand often risky behaviors\nthat are so characteristic of adolescence\nand that are so terrifying\nto us parents of teenagers.\nThey know that like the rest of us,\nwhen teenagers don't\nget the sleep they need,\ntheir brains, their bodies\nand behaviors suffer\nwith both immediate and lasting effects.\nThey can't concentrate,\ntheir attention plummets\nand many will even show\nbehavioral signs that mimic ADHD.\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nBut the consequences of teen sleep loss\ngo well beyond the classroom,\nsadly contributing to many\nof the mental health problems\nthat skyrocket during adolescence,\nincluding substance use,\ndepression and suicide.\nIn our work with teens\nfrom LA Unified School District,\nwe found that teens with sleep problems\nwere 55 percent more likely\nto have used alcohol in the past month.\nIn another study with over\n30,000 high school students,\nthey found that\nfor each hour of lost sleep,\nthere was a 38 percent increase\nin feeling sad or hopeless,\nand a 58 percent increase\nin teen suicide attempts.\nAnd if that's not enough,\nteens who skip out on sleep\nare at increased risk\nfor a host of physical health problems\nthat plague our country,\nincluding obesity,\nheart disease and diabetes.\nThen there's the risk\nof putting a sleep-deprived teen,\nwith a newly minted driver's license,\nbehind the wheel.\nStudies have shown that getting five hours\nor less of sleep per night\nis the equivalent of driving with a blood\nalcohol content above the legal limit.\n\n\n\n 6:47\n\n\nAdvocates of sleep-friendly start times,\nand researchers in this area,\nhave produced tremendous science\nshowing the tremendous benefits\nof later start times.\nThe findings are unequivocal,\nand as a sleep scientist,\nI rarely get to speak\nwith that kind of certainty.\nTeens from districts\nwith later start times get more sleep.\nTo the naysayers who may think\nthat if schools start later,\nteens will just stay up later,\nthe truth is,\ntheir bedtimes stay the same,\nbut their wake-up times get extended,\nresulting in more sleep.\nThey're more likely to show up for school;\nschool absences dropped\nby 25 percent in one district.\nAnd they're less likely to drop out.\nNot surprisingly,\nthey do better academically.\n\n\n\n 7:36\n\n\nSo this has real implications\nfor reducing the achievement gap.\nStandardized test scores\nin math and reading\ngo up by two to three percentage points.\nThat's as powerful as reducing class sizes\nby one-third fewer students,\nor replacing a so-so teacher\nin the classroom\nwith a truly outstanding one.\nTheir mental and physical health improves,\nand even their families are happier.\nI mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little\nmore pleasantness from our teens,\nand a little less crankiness?\nEven their communities are safer\nbecause car crash rates go down —\na 70 percent reduction in one district.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nGiven these tremendous benefits,\nyou might think,\nwell, this is a no-brainer, right?\nSo why have we as a society\nfailed to heed this call?\nOften the argument against later\nstart times goes something like this:\n\"Why should we delay\nstart times for teenagers?\nWe need to toughen them up\nso they're ready for the real world!\"\nBut that's like saying\nto the parent of a two-year-old,\n\"Don't let Johnny nap,\nor he won't be ready for kindergarten.\"\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:52\n\n\nDelaying start times also presents\nmany logistical challenges.\nNot just for students and their families,\nbut for communities as a whole.\nUpdating bus routes,\nincreased transportation costs,\nimpact on sports,\ncare before or after school.\nThese are the same concerns\nthat come up in district after district,\ntime and again around the country\nas school start times are debated.\nAnd they're legitimate concerns,\nbut these are problems\nwe have to work through.\nThey are not valid excuses\nfor failing to do the right thing\nfor our children,\nwhich is to start middle and high schools\nno earlier than 8:30am.\nAnd in districts around the country,\nbig and small,\nwho have made this change,\nthey found that these fears\nare often unfounded\nand far outweighed by the tremendous\nbenefits for student health\nand performance,\nand our collective public safety.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nSo tomorrow morning,\nwhen coincidentally we get\nto set our clocks back by an hour\nand you get that delicious\nextra hour of sleep,\nand the day seems a little longer,\nand a little more full of hope,\nthink about the tremendous power of sleep.\nAnd think about what a gift it would be\nfor our children to be able\nto wake up naturally,\nin harmony with their own biology.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\nThank you,\nand pleasant dreams.\n\n"
