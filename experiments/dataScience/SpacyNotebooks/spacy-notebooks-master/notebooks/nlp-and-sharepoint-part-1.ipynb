    "Yes, Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to how computers and humans interact; more specifically, how a computer program can come to understand what we humans are saying, whether we're writing a sonnet or a scathing review on Netflix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies turn to NLP techniques in order to get a better understanding of the needs, motivations and problems of their users. Netflix, for example, is well-known for its movie recommendation system, which uses NLP to determine what people are saying about a film or television show. Other sites and applications use NLP to help identify shills, so they can better hide reviews from people who post artificial praise about a product in order to boost the ranking of that product artificially.\n",

    "Let me whet your appetite, and show you what sorts of things you can do when you apply some of the latest techniques and tools devoted to improving the state of NLP."

Four out of five data scientists may agree that statistics are mostly made up on the spot, but many of them use Python (and a really amazing library called Jupyter Notebooks, formerly known as IPython Notebooks) when they're *doing data science*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest, simplest way to get set up for Windows, Mac and Linux users is a [distribution of Python called Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). It's pretty amazing, actually. It bundles together hundreds of the most popular Python packages used for science, analytics, engineering and mathematics, and sets up all the necessary plumbing to run Python with those packages either from the command line or via an interactive web-based editor called a Jupyter Notebook. In fact, this whole article was written as a Jupyter Notebook, so once you have it installed, you can even try some of these examples out yourself."

    "review = '''The Road-550-W from Adventure Works Cycles is everything it's advertised to be. Finally, a quality bike that is actually built for a woman and provides control and comfort in one neat package. The top tube is shorter, the suspension is weight-tuned and there's a much shorter reach to the brake levers. All this adds up to a great mountain bike that is sure to accommodate any woman's anatomy. In addition to getting the size right, the saddle is incredibly comfortable. Attention to detail is apparent in every aspect from the frame finish to the careful design of each component. Each component is a solid performer without any fluff. The designers clearly did their homework and thought about size, weight, and funtionality throughout. And at less than 19 pounds, the bike is manageable for even the most petite cyclist. We had 5 riders, including my good friend Dr. Joseph A. Bicycle, and his wife, Mrs. Jane Bicycle, take the bike out for a spin and really put it to the test. The results were consistent and very positive. Our testers loved the manuverability and control they had with the redesigned frame on the 550-W. A definite improvement over the 2002 design. Four out of five testers listed quick handling and responsivness were the key elements they noticed. Technical climbing and on the flats, the bike just cruises through the rough. Tight corners and obstacles were handled effortlessly. The fifth tester was more impressed with the smooth ride. The heavy-duty shocks absorbed even the worst bumps and provided a soft ride on all but the nastiest trails and biggest drops. The shifting was rated superb and typical of what we've come to expect from Adventure Works Cycles. On descents, the bike handled flawlessly and tracked very well. The bike is well balanced front-to-rear and frame flex was minimal. In particular, the testers noted that the brake system had a unique combination of power and modulation.  While some brake setups can be overly touchy, these brakes had a good amount of power, but also a good feel that allows you to apply as little or as much braking power as is needed. Second is their short break-in period. We found that they tend to break-in well before the end of the first ride; while others take two to three rides (or more) to come to full power. On the negative side, the pedals were not quite up to our tester's standards. Just for fun, we experimented with routine maintenance tasks. Overall we found most operations to be straight forward and easy to complete. The only exception was replacing the front wheel. The maintenance manual that comes with the bike say to install the front wheel with the axle quick release or bolt, then compress the fork a few times before fastening and tightening the two quick-release mechanisms on the bottom of the dropouts. This is to seat the axle in the dropouts, and if you do not do this, the axle will become seated after you tightened the two bottom quick releases, which will then become loose. It's better to test the tightness carefully or you may notice that the two bottom quick releases have come loose enough to fall completely open. And that's something you don't want to experience while out on the road! The Road-550-W frame is available in a variety of sizes and colors and has the same durable, high-quality aluminum that AWC is known for. At a MSRP of just under $1125.00, it's comparable in price to its closest competitors and we think that after a test drive you'l find the quality and performance above and beyond . You'll have a grin on your face and be itching to get out on the road for more. While designed for serious road racing, the Road-550-W would be an excellent choice for just about any terrain and any level of experience. It's a huge step in the right direction for female cyclists and well worth your consideration and hard-earned money.'''"
