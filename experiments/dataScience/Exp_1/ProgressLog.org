* Experiment-1
  *AIM* : Read all the json files from `../sampleJSON` directory and store the number of languages avl per talk 
  into a json file of languages per file. 
 

  The structure needs to be something like 
```
{
talkTitle_1 : { ar, fr, no},
talkTitle_2 : {de, eo, zh_cn}
}
```

*** I'll start with the `julia` lang.

*** Julia effortlessly takes care of the non-unicode encodings in the source json files.

*** install vim and git-plus

*** The basic goal has been achieved...

*** And in the process, I realized that the form that I want is that of 

```
{
id: talkTitle_1 : { ar, fr, no},
id: talkTitle_2 : {de, eo, zh_cn}
}
```

*** Installed *pomodoro*
