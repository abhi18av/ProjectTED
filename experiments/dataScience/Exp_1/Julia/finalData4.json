      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nAs patients,\nwe usually remember\nthe names of our doctors,\nbut often we forget\nthe names of our nurses.\nI remember one.\nI had breast cancer a few years ago,\nand somehow I managed\nto get through the surgeries\nand the beginning\nof the treatment just fine.\nI could hide what was going on.\nEverybody didn't really have to know.\nI could walk my daughter to school,\nI could go out to dinner with my husband;\nI could fool people.\nBut then my chemo was scheduled to begin\nand that terrified me\nbecause I knew that I was going to lose\nevery single hair on my body\nbecause of the kind of chemo\nthat I was going to have.\nI wasn't going to be able\nto pretend anymore\nas though everything was normal.\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\nI was scared.\nI knew what it felt like to have\neverybody treating me with kid gloves,\nand I just wanted to feel normal.\nI had a port installed in my chest.\nI went to my first day of chemotherapy,\nand I was an emotional wreck.\nMy nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,\nand every bone in my body was telling\nme to get up out of that chair\nand take for the hills.\nBut Joanne looked at me and talked\nto me like we were old friends.\nAnd then she asked me,\n\"Where'd you get your highlights done?\"\n\n\n\n 1:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\nAnd I was like, are you kidding me?\nYou're going to talk to me about my hair\nwhen I'm on the verge of losing it?\nI was kind of angry,\nand I said, \"Really? Hair?\"\nAnd with a shrug\nof her shoulders she said,\n\"It's gonna grow back.\"\nAnd in that moment she said\nthe one thing I had overlooked,\nand that was that at some point,\nmy life would get back to normal.\nShe really believed that.\nAnd so I believed it, too.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nNow, worrying about losing your hair\nwhen you're fighting cancer\nmay seem silly at first,\nbut it's not just that you're worried\nabout how you're going to look.\nIt's that you're worried that everybody's\ngoing to treat you so carefully.\nJoanne made me feel normal\nfor the first time in six months.\nWe talked about her boyfriends,\nwe talked about looking\nfor apartments in New York City,\nand we talked about my reaction\nto the chemotherapy —\nall kind of mixed in together.\nAnd I always wondered,\nhow did she so instinctively\nknow just how to talk to me?\n\n\n\n 2:34\n\n\nJoanne Staha and my admiration for her\nmarked the beginning of my journey\ninto the world of nurses.\nA few years later,\nI was asked to do a project\nthat would celebrate\nthe work that nurses do.\nI started with Joanne,\nand I met over 100 nurses\nacross the country.\nI spent five years interviewing,\nphotographing and filming nurses\nfor a book and a documentary film.\nWith my team,\nwe mapped a trip across America\nthat would take us to places\ndealing with some of the biggest\npublic health issues facing our nation —\naging, war, poverty, prisons.\nAnd then we went places\nwhere we would find\nthe largest concentration of patients\ndealing with those issues.\nThen we asked hospitals and facilities\nto nominate nurses\nwho would best represent them.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\nOne of the first nurses I met\nwas Bridget Kumbella.\nBridget was born in Cameroon,\nthe oldest of four children.\nHer father was at work\nwhen he had fallen from the fourth floor\nand really hurt his back.\nAnd he talked a lot about what it was like\nto be flat on your back\nand not get the kind\nof care that you need.\nAnd that propelled Bridget\nto go into the profession of nursing.\nNow, as a nurse in the Bronx,\nshe has a really diverse group\nof patients that she cares for,\nfrom all walks of life,\nand from all different religions.\nAnd she's devoted her career\nto understanding the impact\nof our cultural differences\nwhen it comes to our health.\nShe spoke of a patient —\na Native American patient that she had —\nthat wanted to bring\na bunch of feathers into the ICU.\nThat's how he found spiritual comfort.\nAnd she spoke of advocating for him\nand said that patients come\nfrom all different religions\nand use all different kinds\nof objects for comfort;\nwhether it's a holy rosary\nor a symbolic feather,\nit all needs to be supported.\n\n\n\n 4:40\n\n\nThis is Jason Short.\nJason is a home health nurse\nin the Appalachian mountains,\nand his dad had a gas station\nand a repair shop when he was growing up.\nSo he worked on cars in the community\nthat he now serves as a nurse.\nWhen he was in college,\nit was just not macho at all\nto become a nurse,\nso he avoided it for years.\nHe drove trucks for a little while,\nbut his life path was always\npulling him back to nursing.\nAs a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,\nJason goes places\nthat an ambulance can't even get to.\nIn this photograph,\nhe's standing in what used to be a road.\nTop of the mountain mining\nflooded that road,\nand now the only way\nfor Jason to get to the patient\nliving in that house\nwith black lung disease\nis to drive his SUV\nagainst the current up that creek.\nThe day I was with him,\nwe ripped the front fender off the car.\nThe next morning he got up,\nput the car on the lift,\nfixed the fender,\nand then headed out\nto meet his next patient.\nI witnessed Jason\ncaring for this gentleman\nwith such enormous compassion,\nand I was struck again by how intimate\nthe work of nursing really is.\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nWhen I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.\nHe had just come back from a deployment\nand he hadn't really settled back in\nto life in San Diego yet.\nHe talked about his experience\nof being a nurse in Germany\nand taking care of the soldiers\ncoming right off the battlefield.\nVery often, he would be\nthe first person they would see\nwhen they opened\ntheir eyes in the hospital.\nAnd they would look at him\nas they were lying there,\nmissing limbs,\nand the first thing they would say is,\n\"When can I go back?\nI left my brothers out there.\"\nAnd Brian would have to say,\n\"You're not going anywhere.\nYou've already given enough, brother.\"\nBrian is both a nurse and a soldier\nwho's seen combat.\nSo that puts him in a unique position\nto be able to relate to and help heal\nthe veterans in his care.\n\n\n\n 6:52\n\n\nThis is Sister Stephen,\nand she runs a nursing home\nin Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.\nAnd the entire circle of life\ncan be found under her roof.\nShe grew up wishing they lived on a farm,\nso given the opportunity\nto adopt local farm animals,\nshe enthusiastically brings them in.\nAnd in the springtime,\nthose animals have babies.\nAnd Sister Stephen uses\nthose baby ducks, goats and lambs\nas animal therapy\nfor the residents at Villa Loretto\nwho sometimes can't\nremember their own name,\nbut they do rejoice\nin the holding of a baby lamb.\nThe day I was with Sister Stephen,\nI needed to take her away\nfrom Villa Loretto\nto film part of her story.\nAnd before we left,\nshe went into the room of a dying patient.\nAnd she leaned over and she said,\n\"I have to go away for the day,\nbut if Jesus calls you,\nyou go.\nYou go straight home to Jesus.\"\nI was standing there and thinking\nit was the first time in my life\nI witnessed that you could show\nsomeone you love them completely\nby letting go.\nWe don't have to hold on so tightly.\nI saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto\nthan I have ever seen at any other time\nat any other place in my life.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nWe live in a complicated time\nwhen it comes to our health care.\nIt's easy to lose sight\nof the need for quality of life,\nnot just quantity of life.\nAs new life-saving\ntechnologies are created,\nwe're going to have really\ncomplicated decisions to make.\nThese technologies often save lives,\nbut they can also prolong pain\nand the dying process.\nHow in the world are we supposed\nto navigate these waters?\nWe're going to need\nall the help we can get.\nNurses have a really unique\nrelationship with us\nbecause of the time spent at bedside.\nDuring that time,\na kind of emotional intimacy develops.\n\n\n\n 9:05\n\n\nThis past summer, on August 9,\nmy father died of a heart attack.\nMy mother was devastated,\nand she couldn't imagine\nher world without him in it.\nFour days later she fell,\nshe broke her hip,\nshe needed surgery\nand she found herself\nfighting for her own life.\nOnce again I found myself\non the receiving end\nof the care of nurses —\nthis time for my mom.\nMy brother and my sister and I\nstayed by her side\nfor the next three days in the ICU.\nAnd as we tried\nto make the right decisions\nand follow my mother's wishes,\nwe found that we were depending\nupon the guidance of nurses.\nAnd once again,\nthey didn't let us down.\nThey had an amazing insight\nin terms of how to care for my mom\nin the last four days of her life.\nThey brought her comfort\nand relief from pain.\nThey knew to encourage my sister and I\nto put a pretty nightgown on my mom,\nlong after it mattered to her,\nbut it sure meant a lot to us.\nAnd they knew to come and wake me up\njust in time for my mom's last breath.\nAnd then they knew\nhow long to leave me in the room\nwith my mother after she died.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nI have no idea how they know these things,\nbut I do know that I am eternally grateful\nthat they've guided me once again.\n\n\n\n10:39\n\n\nThank you so very much.\n\n\n\n10:41\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nSo I've been \"futuring,\"\nwhich is a term I made up —\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:16\n\n\nabout three seconds ago.\nI've been futuring for about 20 years,\nand when I first started,\nI would sit down with people,\nand say, \"Hey,\nlet's talk 10, 20 years out.\"\nAnd they'd say, \"Great.\"\nAnd I've been seeing that time horizon\nget shorter and shorter\nand shorter,\nso much so that I met\nwith a CEO two months ago\nand I said — we started\nour initial conversation.\nHe goes, \"I love what you do.\nI want to talk about the next six months.\"\n\n\n\n 0:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nWe have a lot of problems\nthat we are facing.\nThese are civilizational-scale problems.\nThe issue though is,\nwe can't solve them\nusing the mental models\nthat we use right now\nto try and solve these problems.\nYes, a lot of great\ntechnical work is being done,\nbut there is a problem that\nwe need to solve for a priori, before,\nif we want to really\nmove the needle on those big problems.\n\"Short-termism.\"\nRight? There's no marches.\nThere's no bracelets.\nThere's no petitions that you can sign\nto be against short-termism.\nI tried to put one up, and no one signed.\nIt was weird.\n\n\n\n 1:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:28\n\n\nBut it prevents us from doing so much.\nShort-termism, for many reasons,\nhas pervaded every\nnook and cranny of our reality.\nI just want you to take a second\nand just think about an issue\nthat you're thinking, working on.\nIt could be personal, it could be at work\nor it could be\nmove-the-needle world stuff,\nand think about\nhow far out you tend to think\nabout the solution set for that.\n\n\n\n 1:52\n\n\nBecause short-termism prevents the CEO\nfrom buying really\nexpensive safety equipment.\nIt'll hurt the bottom line.\nSo we get the Deepwater Horizon.\nShort-termism prevents teachers\nfrom spending quality\none-on-one time with their students.\nSo right now in America,\na high school student\ndrops out every 26 seconds.\nShort-termism prevents Congress —\nsorry if there's anyone\nin here from Congress —\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:25\n\n\nor not really that sorry —\n\n\n\n 2:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:29\n\n\nfrom putting money\ninto a real infrastructure bill.\nSo what we get\nis the I-35W bridge collapse\nover the Mississippi a few years ago,\n13 killed.\nIt wasn't always like this.\nWe did the Panama Canal.\nWe pretty much\nhave eradicated global polio.\nWe did the transcontinental railroad,\nthe Marshall Plan.\nAnd it's not just big, physical\ninfrastructure problems and issues.\nWomen's suffrage, the right to vote.\nBut in our short-termist time,\nwhere everything seems to happen right now\nand we can only think out\npast the next tweet or timeline post,\nwe get hyper-reactionary.\n\n\n\n 3:07\n\n\nSo what do we do?\nWe take people who are fleeing\ntheir war-torn country,\nand we go after them.\nWe take low-level drug offenders,\nand we put them away for life.\nAnd then we build McMansions\nwithout even thinking\nabout how people are going\nto get between them and their job.\nIt's a quick buck.\n\n\n\n 3:25\n\n\nNow, the reality is,\nfor a lot of these problems,\nthere are some technical fixes,\na lot of them.\nI call these technical fixes\nsandbag strategies.\nSo you know there's a storm coming,\nthe levee is broken,\nno one's put any money into it,\nyou surround your home with sandbags.\nAnd guess what? It works.\nStorm goes away,\nthe water level goes down,\nyou get rid of the sandbags,\nand you do this storm\nafter storm after storm.\nAnd here's the insidious thing.\nA sandbag strategy\ncan get you reelected.\nA sandbag strategy\ncan help you make your quarterly numbers.\n\n\n\n 4:05\n\n\nNow, if we want to move forward\ninto a different future\nthan the one we have right now,\nbecause I don't think we've hit —\n2016 is not peak civilization.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:16\n\n\nThere's some more we can do.\nBut my argument is that unless we shift\nour mental models and our mental maps\non how we think about the short,\nit's not going to happen.\n\n\n\n 4:27\n\n\nSo what I've developed\nis something called \"longpath,\"\nand it's a practice.\nAnd longpath isn't\na kind of one-and-done exercise.\nI'm sure everyone here\nat some point has done an off-site\nwith a lot of Post-It notes\nand whiteboards,\nand you do —\nno offense to the consultants\nin here who do that —\nand you do a long-term plan,\nand then two weeks later,\neveryone forgets about it.\nRight? Or a week later.\nIf you're lucky, three months.\nIt's a practice because\nit's not necessarily a thing that you do.\nIt's a process where you have\nto revisit different ways of thinking\nfor every major decision\nthat you're working on.\nSo I want to go through\nthose three ways of thinking.\n\n\n\n 5:08\n\n\nSo the first: transgenerational thinking.\nI love the philosophers:\nPlato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.\nI was raised on them.\nBut they all did one thing\nthat didn't actually seem like a big deal\nuntil I really started\nkind of looking into this.\nAnd they all took,\nas a unit of measure\nfor their entire reality\nof what it meant to be virtuous and good,\nthe single lifespan,\nfrom birth to death.\nBut here's a problem with these issues:\nthey stack up on top of us,\nbecause the only way we know\nhow to do something good in the world\nis if we do it between\nour birth and our death.\nThat's what we're programmed to do.\nIf you go to the self-help section\nin any bookstore,\nit's all about you.\nWhich is great,\nunless you're dealing\nwith some of these major issues.\nAnd so with transgenerational thinking,\nwhich is really kind of\ntransgenerational ethics,\nyou're able to expand\nhow you think about these problems,\nwhat is your role\nin helping to solve them.\n\n\n\n 6:12\n\n\nNow, this isn't something that just has to\nbe done at the Security Council chamber.\nIt's something that you can do\nin a very kind of personal way.\nSo every once in a while, if I'm lucky,\nmy wife and I like to go out to dinner,\nand we have three children\nunder the age of seven.\nSo you can imagine\nit's a very peaceful, quiet meal.\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:32\n\n\nSo we sit down and literally\nall I want to do is just eat and chill,\nand my kids have a completely\nand totally different idea\nof what we're going to be doing.\nAnd so my first idea\nis my sandbag strategy, right?\nIt's to go into my pocket\nand take out the iPhone\nand give them \"Frozen\"\nor some other bestselling game thing.\nAnd then I stop\nand I have to kind of put on\nthis transgenerational thinking cap.\nI don't do this in the restaurant,\nbecause it would be bizarre,\nbut I have to —\nI did it once, and that's how\nI learned it was bizarre.\n\n\n\n 7:09\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nAnd you have to kind of think,\n\"OK, I can do this.\"\nBut what is this teaching them?\nSo what does it mean\nif I actually bring some paper\nor engage with them in conversation?\nIt's hard. It's not easy,\nand I'm making this very personal.\nIt's actually more traumatic\nthan some of the big issues\nthat I work on in the world —\nentertaining my kids at dinner.\nBut what it does is it connects them\nhere in the present with me,\nbut it also —\nand this is the crux\nof transgenerational thinking ethics —\nit sets them up to how they're\ngoing to interact with their kids\nand their kids and their kids.\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nSecond, futures thinking.\nWhen we think about the future,\n10, 15 years out,\ngive me a vision of what the future is.\nYou don't have to give it to me,\nbut think in your head.\nAnd what you're probably going to see\nis the dominant cultural lens\nthat dominates our thinking\nabout the future right now:\ntechnology.\nSo when we think about the problems,\nwe always put it through\na technological lens,\na tech-centric, a techno-utopia,\nand there's nothing wrong with that,\nbut it's something that we have to\nreally think deeply about\nif we're going to move\non these major issues,\nbecause it wasn't always like this. Right?\nThe ancients had their way of thinking\nabout what the future was.\nThe Church definitely had their idea\nof what the future could be,\nand you could actually pay your way\ninto that future. Right?\nAnd luckily for humanity,\nwe got the scientific revolution.\nFrom there, we got the technology,\nbut what has happened —\nAnd by the way, this is not a critique.\nI love technology.\nEverything in my house talks back to me,\nfrom my children\nto my speakers to everything.\n\n\n\n 8:55\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\nBut we've abdicated the future\nfrom the high priests in Rome\nto the high priests of Silicon Valley.\nSo when we think, well,\nhow are we going to deal with climate\nor with poverty or homelessness,\nour first reaction is to think about it\nthrough a technology lens.\nAnd look, I'm not advocating\nthat we go to this guy.\nI love Joel, don't get me wrong,\nbut I'm not saying we go to Joel.\nWhat I'm saying is we have to rethink\nour base assumption about\nonly looking at the future in one way,\nonly looking at it\nthrough the dominant lens.\nBecause our problems\nare so big and so vast\nthat we need to open ourselves up.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nSo that's why I do everything in my power\nnot to talk about the future.\nI talk about futures.\nIt opens the conversation again.\nSo when you're sitting and thinking\nabout how do we move forward\non this major issue —\nit could be at home,\nit could be at work,\nit could be again on the global stage —\ndon't cut yourself off from thinking\nabout something beyond technology as a fix\nbecause we're more concerned\nabout technological evolution right now\nthan we are about moral evolution.\nAnd unless we fix for that,\nwe're not going to be able\nto get out of short-termism\nand get to where we want to be.\n\n\n\n10:18\n\n\nThe final, telos thinking.\nThis comes from the Greek root.\nUltimate aim and ultimate purpose.\nAnd it's really asking one question:\nto what end?\nWhen was the last time\nyou asked yourself: To what end?\nAnd when you asked yourself that,\nhow far out did you go?\nBecause long isn't long enough anymore.\nThree, five years doesn't cut it.\nIt's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.\n\n\n\n10:45\n\n\nIn Homer's epic, \"The Odyssey,\"\nOdysseus had the answer to his \"what end.\"\nIt was Ithaca.\nIt was this bold vision\nof what he wanted —\nto return to Penelope.\nAnd I can tell you,\nbecause of the work that I'm doing,\nbut also you know it intuitively —\nwe have lost our Ithaca.\nWe have lost our \"to what end,\"\nso we stay on this hamster wheel.\nAnd yes, we're trying\nto solve these problems,\nbut what comes after we solve the problem?\nAnd unless you define what comes after,\npeople aren't going to move.\nThe businesses —\nthis isn't just about business —\nbut the businesses that do consistently,\nwho break out of short-termism\nnot surprisingly\nare family-run businesses.\nThey're transgenerational. They're telos.\nThey think about the futures.\nAnd this is an ad for Patek Philippe.\nThey're 175 years old,\nand what's amazing\nis that they literally embody\nthis kind of longpathian sense\nin their brand,\nbecause, by the way,\nyou never actually own a Patek Philippe,\nand I definitely won't —\n\n\n\n11:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:42\n\n\nunless somebody wants to just\nthrow 25,000 dollars on the stage.\nYou merely look after it\nfor the next generation.\n\n\n\n11:49\n\n\nSo it's important that we remember,\nthe future, we treat it like a noun.\nIt's not. It's a verb.\nIt requires action.\nIt requires us to push into it.\nIt's not this thing that washes over us.\nIt's something that we\nactually have total control over.\nBut in a short-term society,\nwe end up feeling like we don't.\nWe feel like we're trapped.\nWe can push through that.\n\n\n\n12:13\n\n\nNow I'm getting more comfortable\nin the fact that at some point\nin the inevitable future,\nI will die.\nBut because of these new ways\nof thinking and doing,\nboth in the outside world\nand also with my family at home,\nand what I'm leaving my kids,\nI get more comfortable in that fact.\nAnd it's something that a lot of us\nare really uncomfortable with,\nbut I'm telling you,\nthink it through.\nApply this type of thinking\nand you can push yourself past\nwhat's inevitably\nvery, very uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\nAnd it all begins really\nwith yourself asking this question:\nWhat is your longpath?\nBut I ask you, when you ask yourself that\nnow or tonight or behind a steering wheel\nor in the boardroom or the situation room:\npush past the longpath,\nquick, oh, what's my longpath\nthe next three years or five years?\nTry and push past your own life if you can\nbecause it makes you do things\na little bit bigger\nthan you thought were possible.\n\n\n\n13:19\n\n\nYes, we have huge,\nhuge problems out there.\nWith this process, with this thinking,\nI think we can make a difference.\nI think you can make a difference,\nand I believe in you guys.\n\n\n\n13:34\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:35\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nTwenty years ago,\nwhen I was a barrister\nand human rights lawyer\nin full-time legal practice in London,\nand the highest court in the land\nstill convened, some would say\nby an accident of history,\nin this building here,\nI met a young man\nwho had just quit his job\nin the British Foreign Office.\nWhen I asked him, \"Why did you leave,\"\nhe told me this story.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nHe had gone to his boss\none morning and said,\n\"Let's do something\nabout human rights abuses in China.\"\nAnd his boss had replied,\n\"We can't do anything\nabout human rights abuses in China\nbecause we have\ntrade relations with China.\"\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\nSo my friend went away\nwith his tail between his legs,\nand six months later,\nhe returned again to his boss,\nand he said this time,\n\"Let's do something\nabout human rights in Burma,\"\nas it was then called.\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nHis boss once again paused\nand said, \"Oh, but we can't\ndo anything about human rights in Burma\nbecause we don't have\nany trade relations with Burma.\"\n\n\n\n 1:17\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:18\n\n\nThis was the moment\nhe knew he had to leave.\nIt wasn't just the hypocrisy\nthat got to him.\nIt was the unwillingness of his government\nto engage in conflict\nwith other governments,\nin tense discussions,\nall the while, innocent people\nwere being harmed.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nWe are constantly told\nthat conflict is bad\nthat compromise is good;\nthat conflict is bad\nbut consensus is good;\nthat conflict is bad\nand collaboration is good.\nBut in my view,\nthat's far too simple\na vision of the world.\nWe cannot know\nwhether conflict is bad\nunless we know who is fighting,\nwhy they are fighting\nand how they are fighting.\nAnd compromises can be thoroughly rotten\nif they harm people\nwho are not at the table,\npeople who are vulnerable, disempowered,\npeople whom we have\nan obligation to protect.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nNow, you might be\nsomewhat skeptical of a lawyer\narguing about the benefits of conflict\nand creating problems for compromise,\nbut I did also qualify as a mediator,\nand these days, I spend my time\ngiving talks about ethics for free.\nSo as my bank manager likes to remind me,\nI'm downwardly mobile.\nBut if you accept my argument,\nit should change not just the way\nwe lead our personal lives,\nwhich I wish to put\nto one side for the moment,\nbut it will change the way\nwe think about major problems\nof public health and the environment.\nLet me explain.\n\n\n\n 3:03\n\n\nEvery middle schooler\nin the United States,\nmy 12-year-old daughter included,\nlearns that there are\nthree branches of government,\nthe legislative, the executive\nand the judicial branch.\nJames Madison wrote,\n\"If there is any principle\nmore sacred in our Constitution,\nand indeed in any free constitution,\nthan any other,\nit is that which separates\nthe legislative, the executive\nand the judicial powers.\"\nNow, the framers were not just concerned\nabout the concentration\nand exercise of power.\nThey also understood\nthe perils of influence.\nJudges cannot determine\nthe constitutionality of laws\nif they participate in making those laws,\nnor can they hold the other branches\nof government accountable\nif they collaborate with them\nor enter into close\nrelationships with them.\nThe Constitution is,\nas one famous scholar put it,\n\"an invitation to struggle.\"\nAnd we the people are served\nwhen those branches do, indeed,\nstruggle with each other.\n\n\n\n 4:22\n\n\nNow, we recognize\nthe importance of struggle\nnot just in the public sector\nbetween our branches of government.\nWe also know it too in the private sector,\nin relationships among corporations.\nLet's imagine that two American airlines\nget together and agree\nthat they will not drop the price\nof their economy class airfares\nbelow 250 dollars a ticket.\nThat is collaboration,\nsome would say collusion,\nnot competition,\nand we the people are harmed\nbecause we pay more for our tickets.\nImagine similarly\ntwo airlines were to say,\n\"Look, Airline A, we'll take\nthe route from LA to Chicago,\"\nand Airline B says, \"We'll take\nthe route from Chicago to DC,\nand we won't compete.\"\nOnce again, that's collaboration\nor collusion instead of competition,\nand we the people are harmed.\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\nSo we understand\nthe importance of struggle\nwhen it comes to relationships\nbetween branches of government,\nthe public sector.\nWe also understand\nthe importance of conflict\nwhen it comes to relationships\namong corporations,\nthe private sector.\nBut where we have forgotten it\nis in the relationships\nbetween the public and the private.\nAnd governments all over the world\nare collaborating with industry\nto solve problems of public health\nand the environment,\noften collaborating\nwith the very corporations\nthat are creating or exacerbating\nthe problems they are trying to solve.\nWe are told that these relationships\nare a win-win.\nBut what if someone is losing out?\n\n\n\n 6:21\n\n\nLet me give you some examples.\nA United Nations agency\ndecided to address a serious problem:\npoor sanitation in schools in rural India.\nThey did so not just in collaboration\nwith national and local governments\nbut also with a television company\nand with a major\nmultinational soda company.\nIn exchange for less\nthan one million dollars,\nthat corporation received the benefits\nof a months-long promotional campaign\nincluding a 12-hour telethon\nall using the company's logo\nand color scheme.\nThis was an arrangement\nwhich was totally understandable\nfrom the corporation's point of view.\nIt enhances the reputation of the company\nand it creates brand loyalty\nfor its products.\nBut in my view,\nthis is profoundly problematic\nfor the intergovernmental agency,\nan agency that has a mission\nto promote sustainable living.\nBy increasing consumption\nof sugar-sweetened beverages\nmade from scarce local water supplies\nand drunk out of plastic bottles\nin a country that is already\ngrappling with obesity,\nthis is neither sustainable\nfrom a public health\nnor an environmental point of view.\nAnd in order to solve\none public health problem,\nthe agency is sowing the seeds\nof another.\n\n\n\n 7:48\n\n\nThis is just one example\nof dozens I discovered\nin researching a book on the relationships\nbetween government and industry.\nI could also have told you\nabout the initiatives in parks\nin London and throughout Britain,\ninvolving the same company,\npromoting exercise,\nor indeed of the British government\ncreating voluntary pledges\nin partnership with industry\ninstead of regulating industry.\nThese collaborations or partnerships\nhave become the paradigm in public health,\nand once again, they make sense\nfrom the point of view of industry.\nIt allows them to frame\npublic health problems and their solutions\nin ways that are least threatening to,\nmost consonant with\ntheir commercial interests.\nSo obesity becomes a problem\nof individual decision-making,\nof personal behavior,\npersonal responsibility\nand lack of physical activity.\nIt is not a problem,\nwhen framed this way,\nof a multinational food system\ninvolving major corporations.\n\n\n\n 8:54\n\n\nAnd again, I don't blame industry.\nIndustry naturally engages\nin strategies of influence\nto promote its commercial interests.\nBut governments have a responsibility\nto develop counterstrategies\nto protect us\nand the common good.\n\n\n\n 9:13\n\n\nThe mistake that governments are making\nwhen they collaborate in this way\nwith industry\nis that they conflate\nthe common good\nwith common ground.\nWhen you collaborate with industry,\nyou necessarily put off the table\nthings that might promote the common good\nto which industry will not agree.\nIndustry will not agree\nto increased regulation\nunless it believes this will\nstave off even more regulation\nor perhaps knock some competitors\nout of the market.\nNor can companies agree\nto do certain things,\nfor example raise the prices\nof their unhealthy products,\nbecause that would violate\ncompetition law,\nas we've established.\nSo our governments should not confound\nthe common good and common ground,\nespecially when common ground\nmeans reaching agreement with industry.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nI want to give you another example,\nmoving from high-profile collaboration\nto something that is below ground\nboth literally and figuratively:\nthe hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.\nImagine that you purchase a plot of land\nnot knowing the mineral rights\nhave been sold.\nThis is before the fracking boom.\nYou build your dream home on that plot,\nand shortly afterwards,\nyou discover that a gas company\nis building a well pad on your land.\nThat was the plight\nof the Hallowich family.\nWithin a very short period of time,\nthey began to complain of headaches,\nof sore throats, of itchy eyes,\nin addition to the interference\nof the noise, vibration\nand the bright lights\nfrom the flaring of natural gas.\nThey were very vocal in their criticisms,\nand then they fell silent.\nAnd thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,\nwhere this image appeared,\nand one other newspaper,\nwe discovered why they fell silent.\nThe newspapers went to the court and said,\n\"What happened to the Hallowiches?\"\nAnd it turned out the Hallowiches\nhad made a secret settlement\nwith the gas operators, and it was\na take-it-or-leave-it settlement.\nThe gas company said,\nyou can have a six-figure sum\nto move elsewhere\nand start your lives again,\nbut in return\nyou must promise not to speak\nof your experience with our company,\nnot to speak of your\nexperience with fracking,\nnot to speak about the health consequences\nthat might have been revealed\nby a medical examination.\nNow, I do not blame\nthe Hallowiches for accepting\na take-it-or-leave-it settlement\nand starting their lives elsewhere.\nAnd one can understand\nwhy the company would wish\nto silence a squeaky wheel.\nWhat I want to point the finger at\nis the legal and regulatory system,\na system in which there are\nnetworks of agreements\njust like this one\nwhich serve to silence people\nand seal off data points\nfrom public health experts\nand epidemiologists,\na system in which regulators\nwill even refrain\nfrom issuing a violation notice\nin the event of pollution\nif the landowner and the gas company\nagree to settle.\nThis is a system which isn't just\nbad from a public health point of view;\nit exposes hazards to local families\nwho remain in the dark.\n\n\n\n12:38\n\n\nNow, I have given you two examples\nnot because they are isolated examples.\nThey are examples of a systemic problem.\nI could share some counterexamples,\nthe case for example\nof the public official\nwho sues the pharmaceutical company\nfor concealing the fact\nthat its antidepressant increases\nsuicidal thoughts in adolescents.\nI can tell you about the regulator\nwho went after the food company\nfor exaggerating the purported\nhealth benefits of its yogurt.\nAnd I can tell you about the legislator\nwho despite heavy lobbying\ndirected at both sides of the aisle\npushes for environmental protections.\nThese are isolated examples,\nbut they are beacons of light\nin the darkness,\nand they can show us the way.\n\n\n\n13:33\n\n\nI began by suggesting that sometimes\nwe need to engage in conflict.\nGovernments should tussle with,\nstruggle with, at times engage\nin direct conflict with corporations.\nThis is not because governments\nare inherently good\nand corporations are inherently evil.\nEach is capable of good or ill.\nBut corporations understandably\nact to promote their commercial interests,\nand they do so either sometimes\nundermining or promoting the common good.\nBut it is the responsibility\nof governments\nto protect and promote the common good.\nAnd we should insist\nthat they fight to do so.\nThis is because governments\nare the guardians\nof public health;\ngovernments are the guardians\nof the environment;\nand it is governments\nthat are guardians\nof these essential parts\nof our common good.\n\n\n\n14:46\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nWhen I die,\nI would like for my body\nto be laid out to be eaten by animals.\nHaving your body laid out to be eaten\nby animals is not for everyone.\n\n\n\n 0:24\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:25\n\n\nMaybe you have already had\nthe end-of-life talk with your family\nand decided on,\nI don't know, cremation.\nAnd in the interest of full disclosure,\nwhat I am proposing for my dead body\nis not strictly legal at the moment,\nbut it's not without precedent.\n\n\n\n 0:45\n\n\nWe've been laying out our dead\nfor all of human history;\nit's call exposure burial.\nIn fact, it's likely happening\nright now as we speak.\nIn the mountainous regions of Tibet,\nthey practice \"sky burial,\"\na ritual where the body is left\nto be consumed by vultures.\nIn Mumbai, in India,\nthose who follow the Parsi religion\nput their dead in structures\ncalled \"Towers of Silence.\"\nThese are interesting cultural tidbits,\nbut they just haven't really been\nthat popular in the Western world —\nthey're not what you'd expect.\n\n\n\n 1:24\n\n\nIn America, our death traditions\nhave come to be chemical embalming,\nfollowed by burial at your local cemetery,\nor, more recently, cremation.\nI myself, am a recent vegetarian,\nwhich means I spent the first\n30 years or so of my life\nfrantically inhaling animals —\nas many as I could get my hands on.\nWhy, when I die, should they not\nhave their turn with me?\n\n\n\n 1:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:54\n\n\nAm I not an animal?\nBiologically speaking,\nare we not all, in this room, animals?\nAccepting the fact that we are animals\nhas some potentially\nterrifying consequences.\nIt means accepting\nthat we are doomed to decay and die,\njust like any other creature on earth.\n\n\n\n 2:17\n\n\nFor the last nine years,\nI've worked in the funeral industry,\nfirst as a crematory operator,\nthen as a mortician\nand most recently, as the owner\nof my own funeral home.\nAnd I have some good news:\nif you're looking to avoid the whole\n\"doomed to decay and die\" thing:\nyou will have all the help\nin the world in that avoidance\nfrom the funeral industry.\n\n\n\n 2:42\n\n\nIt's a multi-billion-dollar industry,\nand its economic model\nis based on the principle\nof protection, sanitation\nand beautification of the corpse.\nWhether they mean to or not,\nthe funeral industry promotes\nthis idea of human exceptionalism.\nIt doesn't matter what it takes,\nhow much it costs,\nhow bad it is for the environment,\nwe're going to do it\nbecause humans are worth it!\nIt ignores the fact\nthat death can be an emotionally messy\nand complex affair,\nand that there is beauty in decay —\nbeauty in the natural return\nto the earth from whence we came.\nNow, I don't want you to get me wrong —\nI absolutely understand\nthe importance of ritual,\nespecially when it comes\nto the people that we love.\nBut we have to be able\nto create and practice this ritual\nwithout harming the environment,\nwhich is why we need new options.\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\nSo let's return to the idea of protection,\nsanitation and beautification.\nWe'll start with a dead body.\nThe funeral industry\nwill protect your dead body\nby offering to sell your family a casket\nmade of hardwood or metal\nwith a rubber sealant.\nAt the cemetery, on the day of burial,\nthat casket will be lowered\ninto a large concrete or metal vault.\nWe're wasting all of these resources —\nconcretes, metal, hardwoods —\nhiding them in vast\nunderground fortresses.\nWhen you choose burial at the cemetery,\nyour dead body is not coming anywhere\nnear the dirt that surrounds it.\nFood for worms\nyou are not.\n\n\n\n 4:29\n\n\nNext, the industry will sanitize\nyour body through embalming:\nthe chemical preservation of the dead.\nThis procedure drains your blood\nand replaces it with a toxic,\ncancer-causing formaldehyde.\nThey say they do this\nfor the public health\nbecause the dead body can be dangerous,\nbut the doctors in this room will tell you\nthat that claim would only apply\nif the person had died of some wildly\ninfectious disease, like Ebola.\nEven human decomposition,\nwhich, let's be honest,\nis a little stinky and unpleasant,\nis perfectly safe.\nThe bacteria that causes disease\nis not the same bacteria\nthat causes decomposition.\n\n\n\n 5:17\n\n\nFinally, the industry\nwill beautify the corpse.\nThey'll tell you that the natural\ndead body of your mother or father\nis not good enough as it is.\nThey'll put it in makeup.\nThey'll put it in a suit.\nThey'll inject dyes so the person\nlooks a little more alive —\njust resting.\nEmbalming is a cheat code,\nproviding the illusion that death\nand then decay are not the natural end\nfor all organic life on this planet.\n\n\n\n 5:49\n\n\nNow, if this system of beautification,\nsanitation, protection\ndoesn't appeal to you,\nyou are not alone.\nThere is a whole wave of people —\nfuneral directors, designers,\nenvironmentalists —\ntrying to come up with a more\neco-friendly way of death.\nFor these people, death is not necessarily\na pristine, makeup,\npowder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.\nThere's no question\nthat our current methods of death\nare not particularly sustainable,\nwhat with the waste of resources\nand our reliance on chemicals.\nEven cremation,\nwhich is usually considered\nthe environmentally friendly option,\nuses, per cremation,\nthe natural gas equivalent\nof a 500-mile car trip.\n\n\n\n 6:38\n\n\nSo where do we go from here?\nLast summer, I was in the mountains\nof North Carolina,\nhauling buckets of wood chips\nin the summer sun.\nI was at Western Carolina University\nat their \"Body Farm,\"\nmore accurately called\na \"human decomposition facility.\"\nBodies donated to science\nare brought here,\nand their decay is studied\nto benefit the future of forensics.\nOn this particular day,\nthere were 12 bodies laid out\nin various stages of decomposition.\nSome were skeletonized,\none was wearing purple pajamas,\none still had blonde facial hair visible.\nThe forensic aspect is really fascinating,\nbut not actually why I was there.\nI was there because a colleague of mine\nnamed Katrina Spade\nis attempting to create a system,\nnot of cremating the dead,\nbut composting the dead.\n\n\n\n 7:35\n\n\nShe calls the system \"Recomposition,\"\nand we've been doing it with cattle\nand other livestock for years.\nShe imagines a facility\nwhere the family could come\nand lay their dead loved one\nin a nutrient-rich mixture that would,\nin four-to-six weeks,\nreduce the body — bones\nand all — to soil.\nIn those four-to-six weeks,\nyour molecules become other molecules;\nyou literally transform.\n\n\n\n 8:02\n\n\nHow would this fit in\nwith the very recent desire\na lot of people seem to have\nto be buried under a tree,\nor to become a tree when they die?\nIn a traditional cremation,\nthe ashes that are left over —\ninorganic bone fragments —\nform a thick, chalky layer\nthat, unless distributed\nin the soil just right,\ncan actually hurt or kill the tree.\nBut if you're recomposed,\nif you actually become the soil,\nyou can nourish the tree,\nand become the post-mortem contributor\nyou've always wanted to be —\nthat you deserve to be.\n\n\n\n 8:37\n\n\nSo that's one option\nfor the future of cremation.\nBut what about the future of cemeteries?\nThere are a lot of people who think\nwe shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore\nbecause we're running out of land.\nBut what if we reframed it,\nand the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,\nbut its potential savior?\nI'm talking about conservation burial,\nwhere large swaths of land\nare purchased by a land trust.\nThe beauty of this is that once you plant\na few dead bodies in that land,\nit can't be touched,\nit can't be developed on —\nhence the term, \"conservation burial.\"\nIt's the equivalent of chaining yourself\nto a tree post-mortem —\n\"Hell no, I won't go!\nNo, really — I can't.\nI'm decomposing under here.\"\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:27\n\n\nAny money that the family\ngives to the cemetery\nwould go back into protecting\nand managing the land.\nThere are no headstones\nand no graves in the typical sense.\nThe graves are scattered\nabout the property\nunder elegant mounds,\nmarked only by a rock\nor a small metal disk,\nor sometimes only locatable by GPS.\nThere's no embalming,\nno heavy, metal caskets.\nMy funeral home sells a few caskets\nmade out of things like\nwoven willow and bamboo,\nbut honestly, most of our families\njust choose a simple shroud.\nThere are none of the big vaults\nthat most cemeteries require\njust because it makes it easier\nfor them to landscape.\nFamilies can come here;\nthey can luxuriate in nature;\nthey can even plant a tree or a shrub,\nthough only native plants\nto the area are allowed.\nThe dead then blend seamlessly\nin with the landscape.\n\n\n\n10:27\n\n\nThere's hope in conservation cemeteries.\nThey offer dedicated green space\nin both urban and rural areas.\nThey offer a chance to reintroduce\nnative plants and animals to a region.\nThey offer public trails,\nplaces for spiritual practice,\nplaces for classes and events —\nplaces where nature and mourning meet.\nMost importantly,\nthey offer us, once again,\na chance to just decompose\nin a hole in the ground.\nThe soil,\nlet me tell you,\nhas missed us.\n\n\n\n11:08\n\n\nI think for a lot of people,\nthey're starting to get the sense\nthat our current funeral industry\nisn't really working for them.\nFor many of us,\nbeing sanitized and beautified\njust doesn't reflect us.\nIt doesn't reflect\nwhat we stood for during our lives.\nWill changing the way we bury our dead\nsolve climate change?\nNo.\nBut it will make bold moves\nin how we see ourselves\nas citizens of this planet.\nIf we can die in a way\nthat is more humble and self-aware,\nI believe that we stand a chance.\n\n\n\n11:47\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:48\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\n(Video) Announcer: 10 seconds.\nFive, four, three, two, one.\nOfficial top.\nPlus one, two, three, four, five\nsix, seven, eight, nine, ten.\nGuillaume Néry, France.\nConstant weight, 123 meters,\nthree minutes and 25 seconds.\nNational record attempt.\n70 meters.\n[123 meters]\n\n\n\n 2:20\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\n(Video) Judge: White card.\nGuillaume Néry! National record!\n\n\n\n 2:28\n\n\nGuillaume Néry: Thank you.\n\n\n\n 2:30\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nThank you very much,\nthanks for the warm welcome.\nThat dive you just watched is a journey —\na journey between two breaths.\nA journey that takes place\nbetween two breaths —\nthe last one before diving into the water,\nand the first one,\ncoming back to the surface.\nThat dive is a journey\nto the very limits of human possibility,\na journey into the unknown.\nBut it's also, and above all,\nan inner journey,\nwhere a number of things happen,\nphysiologically as well as mentally.\nAnd that's why I'm here today,\nto share my journey with you\nand to take you along with me.\n\n\n\n 3:11\n\n\nSo, we start with the last breath.\n(Breathing in)\n(Breathing out)\nAs you noticed, that last breath\nin is slow, deep and intense.\nIt ends with a special technique\ncalled the carp,\nwhich allows me to store one to two\nextra liters of air in my lungs\nby compressing it.\nWhen I leave the surface,\nI have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.\nAs soon as I leave the surface\nthe first mechanism kicks in:\nthe diving reflex.\nThe first thing the diving reflex does\nis make your heart rate drop.\nMy heart beat will drop\nfrom about 60-70 per minute\nto about 30-40 beats per minute\nin a matter of seconds;\nalmost immediately.\n\n\n\n 4:06\n\n\nNext, the diving reflex causes\nperipheral vasoconstriction,\nwhich means that the blood flow\nwill leave the body's extremities\nto feed the most important organs:\nthe lungs, the heart and the brain.\nThis mechanism is innate.\nI cannot control it.\nIf you go underwater,\neven if you've never done it before,\nyou'll experience the exact same effects.\nAll human beings\nshare this characteristic.\nAnd what's extraordinary\nis that we share this instinct\nwith marine mammals —\nall marine mammals:\ndolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.\nWhen they dive deep into the ocean,\nthese mechanisms become activated,\nbut to a greater extent.\nAnd, of course, it works\nmuch better for them.\nIt's absolutely fascinating.\n\n\n\n 4:56\n\n\nRight as I leave the surface,\nnature gives me a push\nin the right direction,\nallowing me to descend with confidence.\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\nSo as I dive deeper into the blue,\nthe pressure slowly starts\nto squeeze my lungs.\nAnd since it's the amount of air\nin my lungs that makes me float,\nthe farther down I go,\nthe more pressure there is on my lungs,\nthe less air they contain\nand the easier it is for my body to fall.\nAnd at one point,\naround 35 or 40 meters down,\nI don't even need to swim.\nMy body is dense and heavy enough\nto fall into the depths by itself,\nand I enter what's called\nthe free fall phase.\nThe free fall phase\nis the best part of the dive.\nIt's the reason I still dive.\nBecause it feels like\nyou're being pulled down\nand you don't need to do anything.\nI can go from 35 meters to 123 meters\nwithout making a single movement.\nI let myself be pulled by the depths,\nand it feels like I'm flying underwater.\nIt's truly an amazing feeling —\nan extraordinary feeling of freedom.\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nAnd so I slowly continue\nsliding to the bottom.\n40 meters down,\n50 meters down,\nand between 50 and 60 meters,\na second physiological response kicks in.\nMy lungs reach residual volume,\nbelow which they're not supposed\nto be compressed, in theory.\nAnd this second response\nis called blood shift,\nor \"pulmonary erection\" in French.\nI prefer \"blood shift.\"\n\n\n\n 6:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:23\n\n\nSo blood shift — how does it work?\nThe capillaries in the lungs\nbecome engorged with blood —\nwhich is caused by the suction —\nso the lungs can harden\nand protect the whole chest cavity\nfrom being crushed.\nIt prevents the two walls\nof the lungs from collapsing,\nfrom sticking together and caving in.\nThanks to this phenomenon,\nwhich we also share with marine mammals,\nI'm able to continue with my dive.\n\n\n\n 6:48\n\n\n60, 70 meters down,\nI keep falling, faster and faster,\nbecause the pressure is crushing\nmy body more and more.\nBelow 80 meters,\nthe pressure becomes a lot stronger,\nand I start to feel it physically.\nI really start to feel the suffocation.\nYou can see what it looks like —\nnot pretty at all.\nThe diaphragm is completely collapsed,\nthe rib cage is squeezed in,\nand mentally, there is something\ngoing on as well.\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nYou may be thinking,\n\"This doesn't look enjoyable.\nHow do you do it?\"\nIf I relied on my earthly reflexes —\nwhat do we do above water\nwhen there's a problem?\nWe resist, we go against it.\nWe fight.\nUnderwater, that doesn't work.\nIf you try that underwater,\nyou might tear your lungs,\nspit up blood, develop an edema\nand you'll have to stop diving\nfor a good amount of time.\nSo what you need to do, mentally,\nis to tell yourself\nthat nature and the elements\nare stronger than you.\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\nAnd so I let the water crush me.\nI accept the pressure and go with it.\nAt this point, my body\nreceives this information,\nand my lungs start relaxing.\nI relinquish all control,\nand relax completely.\nThe pressure starts crushing me,\nand it doesn't feel bad at all.\nI even feel like\nI'm in a cocoon, protected.\n\n\n\n 8:02\n\n\nAnd the dive continues.\n80, 85 meters down,\n90,\n100.\n100 meters — the magic number.\nIn every sport, it's a magic number.\nFor swimmers and athletes\nand also for us, free divers,\nit's a number everyone dreams of.\nEveryone wishes one day\nto be able to get to 100 meters.\nAnd it's a symbolic number for us,\nbecause in the 1970s,\ndoctors and physiologists did their math,\nand predicted that the human body\nwould not be able to go below 100 meters.\nBelow that, they said,\nthe human body would implode.\nAnd then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol —\nyou all know him as the hero\nin \"The Big Blue\" —\ncame along and dived down to 100 meters.\nHe even reached 105 meters.\nAt that time, he was doing \"no limits.\"\nHe'd use weights to descend faster\nand come back up with a balloon,\njust like in the movie.\nToday, we go down 200 meters\nin no limit free diving.\nI can do 123 meters\nby simply using muscle strength.\nAnd in a way, it's all thanks to him,\nbecause he challenged known facts,\nand with a sweep of his hand,\ngot rid of the theoretical beliefs\nand all the mental limits\nthat we like to impose on ourselves.\nHe showed us that the human body\nhas an infinite ability to adapt.\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nSo I carry on with my dive.\n105, 110, 115.\nThe bottom is getting closer.\n120,\n123 meters.\nI'm at the bottom.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nAnd now, I'd like to ask you to join me\nand put yourself in my place.\nClose your eyes.\nImagine you get to 123 meters.\nThe surface is far, far away.\nYou're alone.\nThere's hardly any light.\nIt's cold —\nfreezing cold.\nThe pressure is crushing you completely —\n13 times stronger than on the surface.\nAnd I know what you're thinking:\n\"This is horrible.\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nHe's insane.\"\nBut no.\nThat's not what I think\nwhen I'm down there.\nWhen I'm at the bottom, I feel good.\nI get this extraordinary\nfeeling of well-being.\nMaybe it's because I've completely\nreleased all tensions\nand let myself go.\nI feel great, without the need to breathe.\n\n\n\n10:16\n\n\nAlthough, you'd agree,\nI should be worried.\nI feel like a tiny dot,\na little drop of water,\nfloating in the middle of the ocean.\nAnd each time, I picture the same image.\n[The Pale Blue Dot]\nIt's that small dot\nthe arrow is pointing to.\nDo you know what it is?\nIt's planet Earth.\nPlanet Earth, photographed\nby the Voyager probe,\nfrom 4 billion kilometers away.\nAnd it shows that our home\nis that small dot over there,\nfloating in the middle of nothing.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\n\nThat's how I feel\nwhen I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.\nI feel like a small dot,\na speck of dust, stardust,\nfloating in the middle of the cosmos,\nin the middle of nothing,\nin the immensity of space.\nIt's a fascinating sensation,\nbecause when I look up, down,\nleft, right, in front, behind,\nI see the same thing:\nthe infinite deep blue.\nNowhere else on Earth\nyou can experience this —\nlooking all around you,\nand seeing the same thing.\nIt's extraordinary.\nAnd at that moment,\nI still get that feeling each time,\nbuilding up inside of me —\nthe feeling of humility.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nLooking at this picture,\nI feel very humble —\njust like when I'm all the way\ndown at the bottom —\nbecause I'm nothing,\nI'm a little speck of nothingness\nlost in all of time and space.\nAnd it still is absolutely fascinating.\nI decide to go back to the surface,\nbecause this is not where I belong.\nI belong up there, on the surface.\n\n\n\n11:47\n\n\nSo I start heading back up.\nI get something of a shock\nat the very moment when I decide to go up.\nFirst, because it takes a huge effort\nto tear yourself away from the bottom.\nIt pulled you down on the way in,\nand will do the same on the way up.\nYou have to swim twice as hard.\nThen, I'm hit with another\nphenomenon known as narcosis.\nI don't know if you've heard of that.\nIt's called nitrogen narcosis.\nIt's something that happens\nto scuba divers,\nbut it can happen to free divers.\nIt's caused by nitrogen\ndissolving in the blood,\nwhich causes confusion\nbetween the conscious\nand unconscious mind.\nA flurry of thoughts goes spinning\nthrough your head.\nYou can't control them,\nand you shouldn't try to —\nyou have to let it happen.\nThe more you try to control it,\nthe harder it is to manage.\nThen, a third thing happens:\nthe desire to breathe.\nI'm not a fish, I'm a human being,\nand the desire to breathe\nreminds me of that fact.\nAround 60, 70 meters,\nyou start to feel the need to breathe.\nAnd with everything else that's going on,\nyou can very easily lose your ground\nand start to panic.\nWhen that happens, you think,\n\"Where's the surface?\nI want to go up. I want to breathe now.\"\nYou should not do that.\nNever look up to the surface —\nnot with your eyes, or your mind.\nYou should never\npicture yourself up there.\nYou have to stay in the present.\nI look at the rope right in front of me,\nleading me back to the surface.\nAnd I focus on that,\non the present moment.\nBecause if I think\nabout the surface, I panic.\nAnd if I panic, it's over.\nTime goes faster this way.\n\n\n\n13:38\n\n\nAnd at 30 meters: deliverance.\nI'm not alone any more.\nThe safety divers,\nmy guardian angels, join me.\nThey leave the surface,\nwe meet at 30 meters,\nand they escort me\nfor the final few meters,\nwhere potential problems could arise.\nEvery time I see them, I think to myself,\n\"It's thanks to you.\"\nIt's thanks to them,\nmy team, that I'm here.\nIt brings back the sense of humility.\nWithout my team, without all\nthe people around me,\nthe adventure into the deep\nwould be impossible.\nA journey into the deep\nis above all a group effort.\n\n\n\n14:12\n\n\nSo I'm happy to finish\nmy journey with them,\nbecause I wouldn't be here\nif it weren't for them.\n20 meters, 10 meters,\nmy lungs slowly return\nto their normal volume.\nBuoyancy pushes me up to the surface.\nFive meters below the surface,\nI start to breathe out,\nso that as soon as I get\nto the surface all I do is breathe in.\nAnd so I arrive at the surface.\n(Breathing in)\nAir floods into my lungs.\nIt's like being born again, a relief.\nIt feels good.\nThough the journey was extraordinary,\nI do need to feel those small\noxygen molecules fueling my body.\nIt's an extraordinary sensation,\nbut at the same time it's traumatizing.\nIt's a shock to the system,\nas you can you imagine.\nI go from complete darkness\nto the light of day,\nfrom the near-silence of the depths\nto the commotion up top.\nIn terms of touch, I go from the soft,\nvelvety feeling of the water,\nto air rubbing across my face.\nIn terms of smell,\nthere is air rushing into my lungs.\n\n\n\n15:17\n\n\nAnd in return, my lungs open up.\nThey were completely squashed\njust 90 seconds ago,\nand now, they've opened up again.\nSo all of this affects\nquite a lot of things.\nI need a few seconds to come back,\nand to feel \"all there\" again.\nBut that needs to happen quickly,\nbecause the judges are there\nto verify my performance;\nI need to show them\nI'm in perfect physical condition.\nYou saw in the video,\nI was doing a so-called exit protocol.\nOnce at the surface, I have 15 seconds\nto take off my nose clip,\ngive this signal and say\n(English) \"I am OK.\"\nPlus, you need to be bilingual.\n\n\n\n15:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:53\n\n\nOn top of everything —\nthat's not very nice.\nOnce the protocol is completed,\nthe judges show me a white card,\nand that's when the joy starts.\nI can finally celebrate\nwhat has just happened.\n\n\n\n16:06\n\n\nSo, the journey I've just described to you\nis a more extreme version of free diving.\nLuckily, it's far from just that.\nFor the past few years,\nI've been trying to show\nanother side of free diving,\nbecause the media mainly talks\nabout competitions and records.\nBut free diving is more than just that.\nIt's about being at ease in the water.\nIt's extremely beautiful,\nvery poetic and artistic.\n\n\n\n16:29\n\n\nSo my wife and I decided to film it\nand try to show another side of it,\nmostly to make people want\nto go into the water.\nLet me show you some images\nto finish my story.\nIt's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.\n\n\n\n16:45\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n16:46\n\n\nI'd like you to know that if one day\nyou try to stop breathing,\nyou'll realize that\nwhen you stop breathing,\nyou stop thinking, too.\nIt calms your mind.\n\n\n\n16:58\n\n\nToday, in the 21st century,\nwe're under so much pressure.\nOur minds are overworked,\nwe think at a million miles an hour,\nwe're always stressed.\nBeing able to free dive\nlets you, just for a moment,\nrelax your mind.\nHolding your breath underwater\nmeans giving yourself the chance\nto experience weightlessness.\nIt means being underwater, floating,\nwith your body completely relaxed,\nletting go of all your tensions.\nThis is our plight in the 21st century:\nour backs hurt, our necks hurt,\neverything hurts,\nbecause we're stressed\nand tense all the time.\nBut when you're in the water,\nyou let yourself float,\nas if you were in space.\nYou let yourself go completely.\nIt's an extraordinary feeling.\nYou can finally get in touch\nwith your body, mind and spirit.\nEverything feels better, all at once.\n\n\n\n17:48\n\n\nLearning how to free dive is also\nabout learning to breathe correctly.\nWe breathe with our first breath\nat birth, up until our last one.\nBreathing gives rhythm to our lives.\nLearning how to breathe better\nis learning how to live better.\nHolding your breath in the sea,\nnot necessarily at 100 meters,\nbut maybe at two or three,\nputting on your goggles,\na pair of flippers,\nmeans you can go see another world,\nanother universe, completely magical.\nYou can see little fish, seaweed,\nthe flora and fauna,\nyou can watch it all discreetly,\nsliding underwater, looking around,\nand coming back to the surface,\nleaving no trace.\nIt's an amazing feeling\nto become one with nature like that.\n\n\n\n18:32\n\n\nAnd if I may say one more thing,\nholding your breath, being in the water,\nfinding this underwater world —\nit's all about connecting with yourself.\nYou heard me talk a lot\nabout the body's memory\nthat dates back millions of years,\nto our marine origins.\nThe day you get back into the water,\nwhen you hold your breath\nfor a few seconds,\nyou will reconnect with those origins.\nAnd I guarantee\nit's absolute magic.\nI encourage you to try it out.\n\n\n\n19:03\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n19:04\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI'm going to be talking\nabout statistics today.\nIf that makes you immediately feel\na little bit wary, that's OK,\nthat doesn't make you some\nkind of crazy conspiracy theorist,\nit makes you skeptical.\nAnd when it comes to numbers,\nespecially now, you should be skeptical.\nBut you should also be able to tell\nwhich numbers are reliable\nand which ones aren't.\nSo today I want to try to give you\nsome tools to be able to do that.\nBut before I do,\nI just want to clarify which numbers\nI'm talking about here.\nI'm not talking about claims like,\n\"9 out of 10 women recommend\nthis anti-aging cream.\"\nI think a lot of us always\nroll our eyes at numbers like that.\nWhat's different now is people\nare questioning statistics like,\n\"The US unemployment\nrate is five percent.\"\nWhat makes this claim different is\nit doesn't come from a private company,\nit comes from the government.\n\n\n\n 0:54\n\n\nAbout 4 out of 10 Americans\ndistrust the economic data\nthat gets reported by government.\nAmong supporters of President Trump\nit's even higher;\nit's about 7 out of 10.\nI don't need to tell anyone here\nthat there are a lot of dividing lines\nin our society right now,\nand a lot of them start to make sense,\nonce you understand people's relationships\nwith these government numbers.\nOn the one hand, there are those who say\nthese statistics are crucial,\nthat we need them to make sense\nof society as a whole\nin order to move beyond\nemotional anecdotes\nand measure progress\nin an [objective] way.\nAnd then there are the others,\nwho say that these statistics are elitist,\nmaybe even rigged;\nthey don't make sense\nand they don't really reflect\nwhat's happening\nin people's everyday lives.\n\n\n\n 1:34\n\n\nIt kind of feels like that second group\nis winning the argument right now.\nWe're living in a world\nof alternative facts,\nwhere people don't find statistics\nthis kind of common ground,\nthis starting point for debate.\nThis is a problem.\nThere are actually\nmoves in the US right now\nto get rid of some government\nstatistics altogether.\nRight now there's a bill in congress\nabout measuring racial inequality.\nThe draft law says that government\nmoney should not be used\nto collect data on racial segregation.\nThis is a total disaster.\nIf we don't have this data,\nhow can we observe discrimination,\nlet alone fix it?\nIn other words:\nHow can a government create fair policies\nif they can't measure\ncurrent levels of unfairness?\nThis isn't just about discrimination,\nit's everything — think about it.\nHow can we legislate on health care\nif we don't have good data\non health or poverty?\nHow can we have public debate\nabout immigration\nif we can't at least agree\non how many people are entering\nand leaving the country?\nStatistics come from the state;\nthat's where they got their name.\nThe point was to better\nmeasure the population\nin order to better serve it.\nSo we need these government numbers,\nbut we also have to move\nbeyond either blindly accepting\nor blindly rejecting them.\nWe need to learn the skills\nto be able to spot bad statistics.\n\n\n\n 2:41\n\n\nI started to learn some of these\nwhen I was working\nin a statistical department\nthat's part of the United Nations.\nOur job was to find out how many Iraqis\nhad been forced from their homes\nas a result of the war,\nand what they needed.\nIt was really important work,\nbut it was also incredibly difficult.\nEvery single day, we were making decisions\nthat affected the accuracy\nof our numbers —\ndecisions like which parts\nof the country we should go to,\nwho we should speak to,\nwhich questions we should ask.\nAnd I started to feel\nreally disillusioned with our work,\nbecause we thought we were doing\na really good job,\nbut the one group of people\nwho could really tell us were the Iraqis,\nand they rarely got the chance to find\nour analysis, let alone question it.\nSo I started to feel really determined\nthat the one way to make\nnumbers more accurate\nis to have as many people as possible\nbe able to question them.\n\n\n\n 3:24\n\n\nSo I became a data journalist.\nMy job is finding these data sets\nand sharing them with the public.\nAnyone can do this,\nyou don't have to be a geek or a nerd.\nYou can ignore those words;\nthey're used by people\ntrying to say they're smart\nwhile pretending they're humble.\nAbsolutely anyone can do this.\n\n\n\n 3:40\n\n\nI want to give you guys three questions\nthat will help you be able to spot\nsome bad statistics.\nSo, question number one\nis: Can you see uncertainty?\nOne of things that's really changed\npeople's relationship with numbers,\nand even their trust in the media,\nhas been the use of political polls.\nI personally have a lot of issues\nwith political polls\nbecause I think the role of journalists\nis actually to report the facts\nand not attempt to predict them,\nespecially when those predictions\ncan actually damage democracy\nby signaling to people:\ndon't bother to vote for that guy,\nhe doesn't have a chance.\nLet's set that aside for now and talk\nabout the accuracy of this endeavor.\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nBased on national elections\nin the UK, Italy, Israel\nand of course, the most recent\nUS presidential election,\nusing polls to predict electoral outcomes\nis about as accurate as using the moon\nto predict hospital admissions.\nNo, seriously, I used actual data\nfrom an academic study to draw this.\nThere are a lot of reasons why\npolling has become so inaccurate.\nOur societies have become really diverse,\nwhich makes it difficult for pollsters\nto get a really nice representative sample\nof the population for their polls.\nPeople are really reluctant to answer\ntheir phones to pollsters,\nand also, shockingly enough,\npeople might lie.\nBut you wouldn't necessarily\nknow that to look at the media.\nFor one thing, the probability\nof a Hillary Clinton win\nwas communicated with decimal places.\nWe don't use decimal places\nto describe the temperature.\nHow on earth can predicting the behavior\nof 230 million voters in this country\nbe that precise?\nAnd then there were those sleek charts.\nSee, a lot of data visualizations\nwill overstate certainty, and it works —\nthese charts can numb\nour brains to criticism.\nWhen you hear a statistic,\nyou might feel skeptical.\nAs soon as it's buried in a chart,\nit feels like some kind\nof objective science,\nand it's not.\n\n\n\n 5:21\n\n\nSo I was trying to find ways\nto better communicate this to people,\nto show people the uncertainty\nin our numbers.\nWhat I did was I started taking\nreal data sets,\nand turning them into\nhand-drawn visualizations,\nso that people can see\nhow imprecise the data is;\nso people can see that a human did this,\na human found the data and visualized it.\nFor example, instead\nof finding out the probability\nof getting the flu in any given month,\nyou can see the rough\ndistribution of flu season.\nThis is —\n\n\n\n 5:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:49\n\n\na bad shot to show in February.\nBut it's also more responsible\ndata visualization,\nbecause if you were to show\nthe exact probabilities,\nmaybe that would encourage\npeople to get their flu jabs\nat the wrong time.\n\n\n\n 6:00\n\n\nThe point of these shaky lines\nis so that people remember\nthese imprecisions,\nbut also so they don't necessarily\nwalk away with a specific number,\nbut they can remember important facts.\nFacts like injustice and inequality\nleave a huge mark on our lives.\nFacts like Black Americans and Native\nAmericans have shorter life expectancies\nthan those of other races,\nand that isn't changing anytime soon.\nFacts like prisoners in the US\ncan be kept in solitary confinement cells\nthat are smaller than the size\nof an average parking space.\n\n\n\n 6:29\n\n\nThe point of these visualizations\nis also to remind people\nof some really important\nstatistical concepts,\nconcepts like averages.\nSo let's say you hear a claim like,\n\"The average swimming pool in the US\ncontains 6.23 fecal accidents.\"\nThat doesn't mean every single\nswimming pool in the country\ncontains exactly 6.23 turds.\nSo in order to show that,\nI went back to the original data,\nwhich comes from the CDC,\nwho surveyed 47 swimming facilities.\nAnd I just spent one evening\nredistributing poop.\nSo you can kind of see\nhow misleading averages can be.\n\n\n\n 6:59\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:00\n\n\nOK, so the second question\nthat you guys should be asking yourselves\nto spot bad numbers is:\nCan I see myself in the data?\nThis question is also\nabout averages in a way,\nbecause part of the reason\nwhy people are so frustrated\nwith these national statistics,\nis they don't really tell the story\nof who's winning and who's losing\nfrom national policy.\nIt's easy to understand why people\nare frustrated with global averages\nwhen they don't match up\nwith their personal experiences.\nI wanted to show people the way\ndata relates to their everyday lives.\nI started this advice column\ncalled \"Dear Mona,\"\nwhere people would write to me\nwith questions and concerns\nand I'd try to answer them with data.\nPeople asked me anything.\nquestions like, \"Is it normal to sleep\nin a separate bed to my wife?\"\n\"Do people regret their tattoos?\"\n\"What does it mean to die\nof natural causes?\"\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nAll of these questions are great,\nbecause they make you think\nabout ways to find\nand communicate these numbers.\nIf someone asks you,\n\"How much pee is a lot of pee?\"\nwhich is a question that I got asked,\nyou really want to make sure\nthat the visualization makes sense\nto as many people as possible.\nThese numbers aren't unavailable.\nSometimes they're just buried\nin the appendix of an academic study.\nAnd they're certainly not inscrutable;\nif you really wanted to test\nthese numbers on urination volume,\nyou could grab a bottle\nand try it for yourself.\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:12\n\n\nThe point of this isn't necessarily\nthat every single data set\nhas to relate specifically to you.\nI'm interested in how many women\nwere issued fines in France\nfor wearing the face veil, or the niqab,\neven if I don't live in France\nor wear the face veil.\nThe point of asking where you fit in\nis to get as much context as possible.\nSo it's about zooming out\nfrom one data point,\nlike the unemployment rate\nis five percent,\nand seeing how it changes over time,\nor seeing how it changes\nby educational status —\nthis is why your parents always\nwanted you to go to college —\nor seeing how it varies by gender.\nNowadays, male unemployment rate is higher\nthan the female unemployment rate.\nUp until the early '80s,\nit was the other way around.\nThis is a story of one\nof the biggest changes\nthat's happened in American society,\nand it's all there in that chart,\nonce you look beyond the averages.\nThe axes are everything;\nonce you change the scale,\nyou can change the story.\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\nOK, so the third and final question\nthat I want you guys to think about\nwhen you're looking at statistics is:\nHow was the data collected?\nSo far, I've only talked about the way\ndata is communicated,\nbut the way it's collected\nmatters just as much.\nI know this is tough,\nbecause methodologies can be opaque\nand actually kind of boring,\nbut there are some simple steps\nyou can take to check this.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nI'll use one last example here.\nOne poll found that 41 percent of Muslims\nin this country support jihad,\nwhich is obviously pretty scary,\nand it was reported everywhere in 2015.\nWhen I want to check a number like that,\nI'll start off by finding\nthe original questionnaire.\nIt turns out that journalists\nwho reported on that statistic\nignored a question\nlower down on the survey\nthat asked respondents\nhow they defined \"jihad.\"\nAnd most of them defined it as,\n\"Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle\nto be more religious.\"\nOnly 16 percent defined it as,\n\"violent holy war against unbelievers.\"\nThis is the really important point:\nbased on those numbers,\nit's totally possible\nthat no one in the survey\nwho defined it as violent holy war\nalso said they support it.\nThose two groups might not overlap at all.\n\n\n\n10:06\n\n\nIt's also worth asking\nhow the survey was carried out.\nThis was something called an opt-in poll,\nwhich means anyone could have found it\non the internet and completed it.\nThere's no way of knowing\nif those people even identified as Muslim.\nAnd finally, there were 600\nrespondents in that poll.\nThere are roughly three million\nMuslims in this country,\naccording to Pew Research Center.\nThat means the poll spoke to roughly\none in every 5,000 Muslims\nin this country.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\nThis is one of the reasons\nwhy government statistics\nare often better than private statistics.\nA poll might speak to a couple\nhundred people, maybe a thousand,\nor if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell\nskin care products in 2005,\nthen you spoke to 48 women\nto claim that they work.\n\n\n\n10:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:43\n\n\nPrivate companies don't have a huge\ninterest in getting the numbers right,\nthey just need the right numbers.\nGovernment statisticians aren't like that.\nIn theory, at least,\nthey're totally impartial,\nnot least because most of them do\ntheir jobs regardless of who's in power.\nThey're civil servants.\nAnd to do their jobs properly,\nthey don't just speak\nto a couple hundred people.\nThose unemployment numbers\nI keep on referencing\ncome from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nand to make their estimates,\nthey speak to over 140,000\nbusinesses in this country.\n\n\n\n11:11\n\n\nI get it, it's frustrating.\nIf you want to test a statistic\nthat comes from a private company,\nyou can buy the face cream for you\nand a bunch of friends, test it out,\nif it doesn't work,\nyou can say the numbers were wrong.\nBut how do you question\ngovernment statistics?\nYou just keep checking everything.\nFind out how they collected the numbers.\nFind out if you're seeing everything\non the chart you need to see.\nBut don't give up on the numbers\naltogether, because if you do,\nwe'll be making public policy\ndecisions in the dark,\nusing nothing but private\ninterests to guide us.\n\n\n\n11:39\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nLast year ...\nwas hell.\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:19\n\n\nIt was my first time eating\nNigerian \"jollof.\"\n\n\n\n 0:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:25\n\n\nActually, in all seriousness,\nI was going through a lot\nof personal turmoil.\nFaced with enormous stress,\nI suffered an anxiety attack.\nOn some days, I could do no work.\nOn other days,\nI just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nMy doctor asked if I'd like to speak\nwith a mental health professional\nabout my stress and anxiety.\nMental health?\nI clammed up and violently\nshook my head in protest.\nI felt a profound sense of a shame.\nI felt the weight of stigma.\nI have a loving, supportive family\nand incredibly loyal friends,\nyet I could not entertain\nthe idea of speaking to anyone\nabout my feeling of pain.\nI felt suffocated\nby the rigid architecture\nof our African masculinity.\n\"People have real problems, Sangu.\nGet over yourself!\"\n\n\n\n 1:39\n\n\nThe first time I heard \"mental health,\"\nI was a boarding school student\nfresh off the boat from Ghana,\nat the Peddie School in New Jersey.\nI had just gone through\nthe brutal experience\nof losing seven loved ones\nin the same month.\nThe school nurse,\nconcerned about what I'd gone\nthrough — God bless her soul —\nshe inquired about my mental health.\n\"Is she mental?\" I thought.\nDoes she not know I'm an African man?\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\nLike Okonkwo in \"Things Fall Apart,\"\nwe African men neither process\nnor express our emotions.\nWe deal with our problems.\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:24\n\n\nWe deal with our problems.\nI called my brother and laughed\nabout \"Oyibo\" people — white people —\nand their strange diseases —\ndepression, ADD and those \"weird things.\"\nGrowing up in West Africa,\nwhen people used the term \"mental,\"\nwhat came to mind was a madman\nwith dirty, dread-locked hair,\nbumbling around half-naked on the streets.\nWe all know this man.\nOur parents warned us about him.\n\"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?\"\n\"Drugs!\nIf you even look at drugs,\nyou end up like him.\"\n\n\n\n 3:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:01\n\n\nCome down with pneumonia,\nand your mother will rush you\nto the nearest hospital\nfor medical treatment.\nBut dare to declare depression,\nand your local pastor\nwill be driving out demons\nand blaming witches in your village.\n\n\n\n 3:18\n\n\nAccording to the World\nHealth Organization,\nmental health is about being able to cope\nwith the normal stressors of life;\nto work productively and fruitfully;\nand to be able to make\na contribution to your community.\nMental health includes our emotional,\npsychological and social well-being.\nGlobally, 75 percent\nof all mental illness cases\ncan be found in low-income countries.\nYet most African governments\ninvest less than one percent\nof their health care budget\nin mental health.\n\n\n\n 3:57\n\n\nEven worse,\nwe have a severe shortage\nof psychiatrists in Africa.\nNigeria, for example,\nis estimated to have 200 —\nin a country of almost 200 million.\nIn all of Africa,\n90 percent of our people\nlack access to treatment.\nAs a result,\nwe suffer in solitude,\nsilenced by stigma.\n\n\n\n 4:28\n\n\nWe as Africans often respond\nto mental health with distance,\nignorance,\nguilt,\nfear\nand anger.\nIn a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez,\ndirectly asking, \"What is the cause\nof mental illness?\"\n34 percent of Nigerian respondents\ncited drug misuse;\n19 percent said divine wrath\nand the will of God —\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\n12 percent,\nwitchcraft and spiritual possession.\nBut few cited other known\ncauses of mental illness,\nlike genetics,\nsocioeconomic status,\nwar,\nconflict\nor the loss of a loved one.\nThe stigmatization against mental illness\noften results in the ostracizing\nand demonizing of sufferers.\nPhotojournalist Robin Hammond\nhas documented some of these abuses ...\nin Uganda,\nin Somalia,\nand here in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\nFor me,\nthe stigma is personal.\nIn 2009,\nI received a frantic call\nin the middle of the night.\nMy best friend in the world —\na brilliant, philosophical,\ncharming, hip young man —\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nI witnessed some of the friends\nwe'd grown up with recoil.\nI heard the snickers.\nI heard the whispers.\n\"Did you hear he has gone mad?\"\n(Kru English) \"He has gone crazy!\"\nDerogatory, demeaning commentary\nabout his condition —\nwords we would never say\nabout someone with cancer\nor someone with malaria.\nSomehow, when it comes to mental illness,\nour ignorance eviscerates all empathy.\nI stood by his side\nas his community isolated him,\nbut our love never wavered.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nTacitly, I became passionate\nabout mental health.\nInspired by his plight,\nI helped found the mental health\nspecial interest alumni group\nat my college.\nAnd during my tenure as a resident\ntutor in graduate school,\nI supported many undergraduates\nwith their mental health challenges.\nI saw African students struggle\nand unable to speak to anyone.\nEven with this knowledge\nand with their stories in tow,\nI, in turn, struggled,\nand could not speak to anyone\nwhen I faced my own anxiety,\nso deep is our fear of being the madman.\n\n\n\n 7:38\n\n\nAll of us —\nbut we Africans especially —\nneed to realize that our mental struggles\ndo not detract from our virility,\nnor does our trauma taint our strength.\nWe need to see mental health\nas important as physical health.\nWe need to stop suffering in silence.\nWe must stop stigmatizing disease\nand traumatizing the afflicted.\n\n\n\n 8:12\n\n\nTalk to your friends.\nTalk to your loved ones.\nTalk to health professionals.\nBe vulnerable.\nDo so with the confidence\nthat you are not alone.\nSpeak up if you're struggling.\nBeing honest about how we feel\ndoes not make us weak;\nit makes us human.\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nIt is time to end the stigma\nassociated with mental illness.\nSo the next time your hear \"mental,\"\ndo not just think of the madman.\nThink of me.\n\n\n\n 8:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

get to heaven, before you do,\nI'll make a hole and pull you through.\nAnd I'll write your name on every star,\nand that way the world\nwon't seem so far.\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nThe astronaut will not be at work today.\nHe has called in sick.\nHe has turned off his cell phone,\nhis laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.\nThere is a fat yellow cat\nasleep on his couch,\nraindrops against the window\nand not even the hint\nof coffee in the kitchen air.\nEverybody is in a tizzy.\nThe engineers on the 15th floor have\nstopped working on their particle machine.\nThe anti-gravity room is leaking,\nand even the freckled kid with glasses,\nwhose only job is to take\nout the trash, is nervous,\nfumbles the bag, spills\na banana peel and a paper cup.\nNobody notices.\nThey are too busy recalculating\nwhat this all mean for lost time.\nHow many galaxies\nare we losing per second?\nHow long before next rocket\ncan be launched?\nSomewhere an electron\nflies off its energy cloud.\nA black hole has erupted.\nA mother finishes setting\nthe table for dinner.\nA Law & Order marathon is starting.\nThe astronaut is asleep.\nHe has forgotten to turn off his watch,\nwhich ticks, like a metal\npulse against his wrist.\nHe does not hear it.\nHe dreams of coral reefs and plankton.\nHis fingers find\nthe pillowcase's sailing masts.\nHe turns on his side,\nopens his eyes at once.\nHe thinks that scuba divers must have\nthe most wonderful job in the world.\nSo much water to glide through!\n\n\n\n 2:22\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:27\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 2:29\n\n\nWhen I was little, I could\nnot understand the concept\nthat you could only live one life.\nI don't mean this metaphorically.\nI mean, I literally thought\nthat I was going to get to do\neverything there was to do\nand be everything there was to be.\nIt was only a matter of time.\nAnd there was no limitation\nbased on age or gender\nor race or even appropriate time period.\nI was sure that I was going\nto actually experience\nwhat it felt like to be a leader\nof the civil rights movement\nor a ten-year old boy living\non a farm during the dust bowl\nor an emperor of the Tang\ndynasty in China.\nMy mom says that when people asked me\nwhat I wanted to be when I grew up,\nmy typical response was:\nprincess-ballerina-astronaut.\nAnd what she doesn't understand\nis that I wasn't trying to invent\nsome combined super profession.\nI was listing things I thought\nI was gonna get to be:\na princess and a ballerina\nand an astronaut.\nand I'm pretty sure the list\nprobably went on from there.\nI usually just got cut off.\nIt was never a question\nof if I was gonna get to do something\nso much of a question of when.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nAnd I was sure that if I was going\nto do everything,\nthat it probably meant I had\nto move pretty quickly,\nbecause there was a lot\nof stuff I needed to do.\nSo my life was constantly\nin a state of rushing.\nI was always scared\nthat I was falling behind.\nAnd since I grew up\nin New York City, as far as I could tell,\nrushing was pretty normal.\nBut, as I grew up, I had\nthis sinking realization,\nthat I wasn't gonna get to live\nany more than one life.\nI only knew what it felt like\nto be a teenage girl\nin New York City,\nnot a teenage boy in New Zealand,\nnot a prom queen in Kansas.\nI only got to see through my lens.\nAnd it was around this time\nthat I became obsessed with stories,\nbecause it was through stories\nthat I was able to see\nthrough someone else's lens,\nhowever briefly or imperfectly.\nAnd I started craving hearing\nother people's experiences\nbecause I was so jealous\nthat there were entire lives\nthat I was never gonna get to live,\nand I wanted to hear\nabout everything that I was missing.\nAnd by transitive property,\nI realized that some people\nwere never gonna get to experience\nwhat it felt like to be a teenage girl\nin New York city.\nWhich meant that they weren't gonna know\nwhat the subway ride\nafter your first kiss feels like,\nor how quiet it gets when its snows.\nAnd I wanted them to know,\nI wanted to tell them.\n\n\n\n 4:55\n\n\nAnd this became the focus of my obsession.\nI busied myself telling stories\nand sharing stories and collecting them.\nAnd it's not until recently\nthat I realized that\nI can't always rush poetry.\nIn April for National Poetry Month,\nthere's this challenge\nthat many poets in the poetry\ncommunity participate in,\nand its called the 30/30 Challenge.\nThe idea is you write a new poem\nevery single day\nfor the entire month of April.\nAnd last year, I tried it\nfor the first time\nand was thrilled by the efficiency\nat which I was able to produce poetry.\nBut at the end of the month, I looked\nback at these 30 poems I had written\nand discovered that they were\nall trying to tell the same story,\nit had just taken me 30 tries to figure\nout the way that it wanted to be told.\nAnd I realized that this is probably true\nof other stories on an even larger scale.\nI have stories that I have\ntried to tell for years,\nrewriting and rewriting and constantly\nsearching for the right words.\n\n\n\n 5:54\n\n\nThere's a French poet and essayist\nby the name of Paul Valéry\nwho said a poem is never\nfinished, it is only abandoned.\nAnd this terrifies me\nbecause it implies that I could keep\nre-editing and rewriting forever\nand its up to me to decide\nwhen a poem is finished\nand when I can walk away from it.\nAnd this goes directly against\nmy very obsessive nature\nto try to find the right answer\nand the perfect words and the right form.\nAnd I use poetry in my life,\nas a way to help me navigate\nand work through things.\nBut just because I end the poem,\ndoesn't mean that I've solved\nwhat it was I was puzzling through.\nI like to revisit old poetry\nbecause it shows me exactly\nwhere I was at that moment\nand what it was I was trying to navigate\nand the words that I chose to help me.\n\n\n\n 6:39\n\n\nNow, I have a story\nthat I've been stumbling\nover for years and years\nand I'm not sure if I've found\nthe prefect form,\nor whether this is just one attempt\nand I will try to rewrite it later\nin search of a better way to tell it.\nBut I do know that later, when I look back\nI will be able to know that\nthis is where I was at this moment\nand this is what I was trying to navigate,\nwith these words, here,\nin this room, with you.\n\n\n\n 7:07\n\n\nSo —\nSmile.\n\n\n\n 7:16\n\n\nIt didn't always work this way.\nThere's a time you had\nto get your hands dirty.\nWhen you were in the dark,\nfor most of it, fumbling was a given.\nIf you needed more\ncontrast, more saturation,\ndarker darks and brighter brights,\nthey called it extended development.\nIt meant you spent longer inhaling\nchemicals, longer up to your wrist.\nIt wasn't always easy.\nGrandpa Stewart was a Navy photographer.\nYoung, red-faced\nwith his sleeves rolled up,\nfists of fingers like fat rolls of coins,\nhe looked like Popeye\nthe sailor man come to life.\nCrooked smile, tuft of chest hair,\nhe showed up to World War II,\nwith a smirk and a hobby.\nWhen they asked him if he knew\nmuch about photography,\nhe lied, learned to read\nEurope like a map,\nupside down, from the height\nof a fighter plane,\ncamera snapping, eyelids flapping\nthe darkest darks and brightest brights.\nHe learned war like he could\nread his way home.\n\n\n\n 8:13\n\n\nWhen other men returned,\nthey would put their weapons out to rest,\nbut he brought the lenses\nand the cameras home with him.\nOpened a shop, turned it\ninto a family affair.\nMy father was born into this\nworld of black and white.\nHis basketball hands learned\nthe tiny clicks and slides\nof lens into frame, film into camera,\nchemical into plastic bin.\nHis father knew the equipment\nbut not the art.\nHe knew the darks but not the brights.\nMy father learned the magic,\nspent his time following light.\nOnce he traveled across the country\nto follow a forest fire,\nhunted it with his camera for a week.\n\"Follow the light,\" he said.\n\"Follow the light.\"\n\n\n\n 8:51\n\n\nThere are parts of me\nI only recognize from photographs.\nThe loft on Wooster Street\nwith the creaky hallways,\nthe twelve-foot ceilings,\nwhite walls and cold floors.\nThis was my mother's home,\nbefore she was mother.\nBefore she was wife, she was artist.\nAnd the only two rooms in the house,\nwith walls that reached\nall the way up to the ceiling,\nand doors that opened and closed,\nwere the bathroom and the darkroom.\nThe darkroom she built herself,\nwith custom-made stainless steel sinks,\nan 8x10 bed enlarger\nthat moved up and down\nby a giant hand crank,\na bank of color-balanced lights,\na white glass wall for viewing prints,\na drying rack that moved\nin and out from the wall.\nMy mother built herself a darkroom.\nMade it her home.\nFell in love with a man\nwith basketball hands,\nwith the way he looked at light.\n\n\n\n 9:38\n\n\nThey got married. Had a baby.\nMoved to a house near a park.\nBut they kept the loft on Wooster Street\nfor birthday parties and treasure hunts.\nThe baby tipped the grayscale,\nfilled her parents' photo albums\nwith red balloons and yellow icing.\nThe baby grew into a girl\nwithout freckles,\nwith a crooked smile,\nwho didn’t understand why her friends\ndid not have darkrooms in their houses,\nwho never saw her parents kiss,\nwho never saw them hold hands.\n\n\n\n10:06\n\n\nBut one day, another baby showed up.\nThis one with perfect straight\nhair and bubble gum cheeks.\nThey named him sweet potato.\nWhen he laughed, he laughed so loudly\nhe scared the pigeons on the fire escape\nAnd the four of them lived\nin that house near the park.\nThe girl with no freckles,\nthe sweet potato boy,\nthe basketball father and darkroom mother\nand they lit their candles\nand said their prayers,\nand the corners of the photographs curled.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nOne day, some towers fell.\nAnd the house near the park\nbecame a house under ash, so they escaped\nin backpacks, on bicycles to darkrooms\nBut the loft of Wooster Street\nwas built for an artist,\nnot a family of pigeons,\nand walls that do not reach the ceiling\ndo not hold in the yelling\nand the man with basketball hands\nput his weapons out to rest.\nHe could not fight this war,\nand no maps pointed home.\nHis hands no longer fit his camera,\nno longer fit his wife's,\nno longer fit his body.\nThe sweet potato boy mashed\nhis fists into his mouth\nuntil he had nothing more to say.\n\n\n\n11:06\n\n\nSo, the girl without freckles\nwent treasure hunting on her own.\nAnd on Wooster Street, in a building\nwith the creaky hallways\nand the loft with the 12-foot ceilings\nand the darkroom with too many sinks\nunder the color-balanced lights,\nshe found a note,\ntacked to the wall with a thumb-tack,\nleft over from a time before towers,\nfrom the time before babies.\nAnd the note said: \"A guy sure loves\nthe girl who works in the darkroom.\"\nIt was a year before my father\npicked up a camera again.\nHis first time out, he followed\nthe Christmas lights,\ndotting their way through\nNew York City's trees,\ntiny dots of light, blinking out at him\nfrom out of the darkest darks.\n\n\n\n11:47\n\n\nA year later he traveled\nacross the country to follow a forest fire\nstayed for a week hunting\nit with his camera,\nit was ravaging the West Coast\neating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride.\nOn the other side of the country,\nI went to class and wrote a poem\nin the margins of my notebook.\nWe have both learned the art of capture.\nMaybe we are learning\nthe art of embracing.\nMaybe we are learning\nthe art of letting go.\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nLike many of us,\nI've had several careers in my life,\nand although they've been varied,\nmy first job set the foundation\nfor all of them.\nI was a home-birth midwife\nthroughout my 20s.\nDelivering babies taught me\nvaluable and sometimes surprising things,\nlike how to start a car at 2am.\nwhen it's 10 degrees below zero.\n\n\n\n 0:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nOr how to revive a father\nwho's fainted at the sight of blood.\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:42\n\n\nOr how to cut the umbilical cord just so,\nto make a beautiful belly button.\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nBut those aren't the things\nthat stuck with me or guided me\nwhen I stopped being a midwife\nand started other jobs.\nWhat stuck with me was this bedrock belief\nthat each one of us comes into this world\nwith a unique worth.\nWhen I looked into the face of a newborn,\nI caught a glimpse of that worthiness,\nthat sense of unapologetic selfhood,\nthat unique spark.\nI use the word \"soul\"\nto describe that spark,\nbecause it's the only word in English\nthat comes close to naming\nwhat each baby brought into the room.\n\n\n\n 1:31\n\n\nEvery newborn was as singular\nas a snowflake,\na matchless mash-up of biology\nand ancestry and mystery.\nAnd then that baby grows up,\nand in order to fit into the family,\nto conform to the culture,\nto the community, to the gender,\nthat little one begins to cover its soul,\nlayer by layer.\nWe're born this way,\nbut —\n\n\n\n 2:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:02\n\n\nBut as we grow, a lot\nof things happen to us\nthat make us ...\nwant to hide our soulful\neccentricities and authenticity.\nWe've all done this.\nEveryone in this room is a former baby —\n\n\n\n 2:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:19\n\n\nwith a distinctive birthright.\nBut as adults, we spend so much\nof our time uncomfortable in our own skin,\nlike we have ADD:\nauthenticity deficit disorder.\nBut not those babies —\nnot yet.\nTheir message to me was:\nuncover your soul\nand look for that soul-spark\nin everyone else.\nIt's still there.\n\n\n\n 2:46\n\n\nAnd here's what I learned\nfrom laboring women.\nTheir message was about staying open,\neven when things are painful.\nA woman's cervix normally looks like this.\nIt's a tight little muscle\nat the base of the uterus.\nAnd during labor,\nit has to stretch from this\nto this.\nOuch!\nIf you fight against that pain,\nyou just create more pain,\nand you block what wants to be born.\n\n\n\n 3:17\n\n\nI'll never forget the magic\nthat would happen\nwhen a woman stopped resisting the pain\nand opened.\nIt was as if the forces\nof the universe took notice\nand sent in a wave of help.\nI never forgot that message,\nand now, when difficult\nor painful things happen to me\nin my life or my work,\nof course at first I resist them,\nbut then I remember\nwhat I learned from the mothers:\nstay open.\nStay curious.\nAsk the pain what it's come to deliver.\nSomething new wants to be born.\n\n\n\n 3:56\n\n\nAnd there was one more big soulful lesson,\nand that one I learned\nfrom Albert Einstein.\nHe wasn't at any of the births, but —\n\n\n\n 4:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\nIt was a lesson about time.\nAt the end of his life,\nAlbert Einstein concluded\nthat our normal, hamster-wheel\nexperience of life\nis an illusion.\nWe run round and round, faster and faster,\ntrying to get somewhere.\nAnd all the while,\nunderneath surface time\nis this whole other dimension\nwhere the past and the present\nand the future merge\nand become deep time.\nAnd there's nowhere to get to.\n\n\n\n 4:41\n\n\nAlbert Einstein called\nthis state, this dimension,\n\"only being.\"\nAnd he said when he experienced it,\nhe knew sacred awe.\nWhen I was delivering babies,\nI was forced off the hamster wheel.\nSometimes I had to sit for days,\nhours and hours,\njust breathing with the parents;\njust being.\nAnd I got a big dose of sacred awe.\n\n\n\n 5:08\n\n\nSo those are the three lessons\nI took with me from midwifery.\nOne: uncover your soul.\nTwo: when things get difficult\nor painful, try to stay open.\nAnd three: every now and then,\nstep off your hamster wheel\ninto deep time.\n\n\n\n 5:29\n\n\nThose lessons have served me\nthroughout my life,\nbut they really served me recently,\nwhen I took on the most\nimportant job of my life thus far.\n\n\n\n 5:41\n\n\nTwo years ago, my younger sister\ncame out of remission\nfrom a rare blood cancer,\nand the only treatment left for her\nwas a bone marrow transplant.\nAnd against the odds,\nwe found a match for her,\nwho turned out to be me.\nI come from a family of four girls,\nand when my sisters found out that\nI was my sister's perfect genetic match,\ntheir reaction was, \"Really? You?\"\n\n\n\n 6:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\n\"A perfect match for her?\"\nWhich is pretty typical for siblings.\nIn a sibling society,\nthere's lots of things.\nThere's love and there's friendship\nand there's protection.\nBut there's also jealousy\nand competition\nand rejection and attack.\nIn siblinghood, that's where we start\nassembling many of those first layers\nthat cover our soul.\n\n\n\n 6:41\n\n\nWhen I discovered I was my sister's match,\nI went into research mode.\nAnd I discovered that\nthe premise of transplants\nis pretty straightforward.\nYou destroy all the bone marrow\nin the cancer patient\nwith massive doses of chemotherapy,\nand then you replace that marrow\nwith several million healthy\nmarrow cells from a donor.\nAnd then you do everything you can\nto make sure that those new cells\nengraft in the patient.\nI also learned that bone marrow\ntransplants are fraught with danger.\nIf my sister made it\nthrough the near-lethal chemotherapy,\nshe still would face other challenges.\nMy cells\nmight attack her body.\nAnd her body might reject my cells.\nThey call this rejection or attack,\nand both could kill her.\n\n\n\n 7:38\n\n\nRejection. Attack.\nThose words had a familiar ring\nin the context of being siblings.\nMy sister and I had\na long history of love,\nbut we also had a long history\nof rejection and attack,\nfrom minor misunderstandings\nto bigger betrayals.\nWe didn't have\nthe kind of the relationship\nwhere we talked about the deeper stuff;\nbut, like many siblings and like people\nin all kinds of relationships,\nwe were hesitant to tell our truths,\nto reveal our wounds,\nto admit our wrongdoings.\n\n\n\n 8:16\n\n\nBut when I learned about\nthe dangers of rejection or attack,\nI thought, it's time to change this.\nWhat if we left the bone marrow\ntransplant up to the doctors,\nbut did something that we later came\nto call our \"soul marrow transplant?\"\nWhat if we faced any pain\nwe had caused each other,\nand instead of rejection or attack,\ncould we listen?\nCould we forgive?\nCould we merge?\nWould that teach our cells to do the same?\n\n\n\n 8:52\n\n\nTo woo my skeptical sister,\nI turned to my parents' holy text:\nthe New Yorker Magazine.\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\nI sent her a cartoon from its pages\nas a way of explaining\nwhy we should visit a therapist\nbefore having my bone marrow harvested\nand transplanted into her body.\nHere it is.\n\n\n\n 9:14\n\n\n\"I have never forgiven him for that thing\nI made up in my head.\"\n\n\n\n 9:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nI told my sister\nwe had probably been doing the same thing,\ncarting around made-up stories\nin our heads that kept us separate.\nAnd I told her that after the transplant,\nall of the blood flowing in her veins\nwould be my blood,\nmade from my marrow cells,\nand that inside the nucleus\nof each of those cells\nis a complete set of my DNA.\n\"I will be swimming around in you\nfor the rest of your life,\"\nI told my slightly horrified sister.\n\n\n\n 9:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:58\n\n\n\"I think we better clean up\nour relationship.\"\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\nA health crisis makes people\ndo all sorts of risky things,\nlike quitting a job\nor jumping out of an airplane\nand, in the case of my sister,\nsaying \"yes\" to several therapy sessions,\nduring which we got down to the marrow.\nWe looked at and released years of stories\nand assumptions about each other\nand blame and shame\nuntil all that was left was love.\n\n\n\n10:37\n\n\nPeople have said I was brave\nto undergo the bone marrow harvest,\nbut I don't think so.\nWhat felt brave to me\nwas that other kind\nof harvest and transplant,\nthe soul marrow transplant,\ngetting emotionally naked\nwith another human being,\nputting aside pride and defensiveness,\nlifting the layers\nand sharing with each other\nour vulnerable souls.\nI called on those midwife lessons:\nuncover your soul.\nOpen to what's scary and painful.\nLook for the sacred awe.\n\n\n\n11:16\n\n\nHere I am with my marrow cells\nafter the harvest.\nThat's they call it — \"harvest,\"\nlike it's some kind of bucolic\nfarm-to-table event —\n\n\n\n11:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:26\n\n\nWhich I can assure you it is not.\nAnd here is my brave, brave sister\nreceiving my cells.\nAfter the transplant, we began to spend\nmore and more time together.\nIt was as if we were little girls again.\nThe past and the present merged.\nWe entered deep time.\nI left the hamster wheel of work and life\nto join my sister\non that lonely island\nof illness and healing.\nWe spent months together —\nin the isolation unit,\nin the hospital and in her home.\n\n\n\n12:09\n\n\nOur fast-paced society\ndoes not support or even value\nthis kind of work.\nWe see it as a disruption\nof real life and important work.\nWe worry about the emotional drain\nand the financial cost —\nand, yes, there is a financial cost.\nBut I was paid\nin the kind of currency our culture\nseems to have forgotten all about.\nI was paid in love.\nI was paid in soul.\nI was paid in my sister.\n\n\n\n12:43\n\n\nMy sister said the year after transplant\nwas the best year of her life,\nwhich was surprising.\nShe suffered so much.\nBut she said life never tasted as sweet,\nand that because of the soul-baring\nand the truth-telling\nwe had done with each other,\nshe became more unapologetically herself\nwith everyone.\nShe said things\nshe'd always needed to say.\nShe did things she always wanted to do.\nThe same happened for me.\nI became braver about being authentic\nwith the people in my life.\nI said my truths,\nbut more important than that,\nI sought the truth of others.\n\n\n\n13:30\n\n\nIt wasn't until\nthe final chapter of this story\nthat I realized just how well\nmidwifery had trained me.\nAfter that best year of my sister's life,\nthe cancer came roaring back,\nand this time there was nothing more\nthe doctors could do.\nThey gave her just\na couple of months to live.\n\n\n\n13:51\n\n\nThe night before my sister died,\nI sat by her bedside.\nShe was so small and thin.\nI could see the blood pulsing in her neck.\nIt was my blood, her blood, our blood.\nWhen she died, part of me would die, too.\n\n\n\n14:11\n\n\nI tried to make sense of it all,\nhow becoming one with each other\nhad made us more ourselves,\nour soul selves,\nand how by facing and opening\nto the pain of our past,\nwe'd finally been delivered to each other,\nand how by stepping out of time,\nwe would now be connected forever.\n\n\n\n14:37\n\n\nMy sister left me with so many things,\nand I'm going to leave you now\nwith just one of them.\nYou don't have to wait\nfor a life-or-death situation\nto clean up the relationships\nthat matter to you,\nto offer the marrow of your soul\nand to seek it in another.\nWe can all do this.\nWe can be like a new kind\nof first responder,\nlike the one to take\nthe first courageous step\ntoward the other,\nand to do something or try to do something\nother than rejection or attack.\nWe can do this with our siblings\nand our mates\nand our friends and our colleagues.\nWe can do this with the disconnection\nand the discord all around us.\nWe can do this for the soul of the world.\n\n\n\n15:35\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:36\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIn the next six minutes\nthat you will listen to me,\nthe world will have lost three mothers\nwhile delivering their babies:\none, because of a severe complication;\nsecond, because she will be a teenager\nand her body will not\nbe prepared for birth;\nbut the third, only because of lack\nof access to basic clean tools\nat the time of childbirth.\nShe will not be alone.\nOver one million mothers and babies\ndie every single year\nin the developing world,\nonly because of lack of access\nto basic cleanliness\nwhile giving birth to their babies.\n\n\n\n 0:55\n\n\nMy journey began on a hot summer afternoon\nin India in 2008,\nwhen after a day of meeting women\nand listening to their needs,\nI landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.\nAs a mother, I was very curious\non how she delivered babies in her house.\nAfter a deep and engaging\nconversation with her\non how she considered it a profound\ncalling to do what she was doing,\nI asked her a parting question:\nDo you have the tools that you need\nto deliver the babies?\nI got to see her tool.\n\"This is what I use to separate\nthe mother and the baby,\" she said.\nUnsure of how to react, I held this\nagricultural tool in my hand in shock.\nI took a picture of this,\nhugged her and walked away.\nMy mind was flooded with reflections\nof my own infection\nthat I had to struggle with\nfor a year past childbirth\ndespite having access\nto the best medical care,\nand memories of my conversation\nwith my father,\nwho had lost his mom to childbirth,\non how he thought his life\nwould be so different\nif she would have been\njust next to him growing up.\n\n\n\n 2:04\n\n\nAs a product developer,\nI started my process of research.\nI was very excited to find\nthat there was a product out there\ncalled the Clean Birth Kit.\nBut I just couldn't buy one for months.\nThey were only assembled\nbased on availability of funding.\nFinally, when I got my hands on one,\nI was in shock again.\nI would never use these tools\nto deliver my baby, I thought.\nBut to confirm my instincts,\nI went back to the women,\nsome of whom had the experience\nof using this product.\n\n\n\n 2:36\n\n\nLo and behold, they had\nthe same reaction and more.\nThe women said they would rather\ndeliver on a floor\nthan on a plastic sheet\nthat smeared blood all over.\nThey were absolutely right —\nit would cause more infection.\nThe thread provided was a highway\nto bacterial infection\nthrough the baby's umbilical cord,\nand the blade used was the kind\nthat men used for shaving,\nand they did not want it\nanywhere close to them.\nThere was no incentive for anybody\nto redesign this product,\nbecause it was based on charity.\nThe women were never\nconsulted in this process.\nAnd to my surprise, the need\nwas not only in homes\nbut also in institutional settings\nwith high-volume births.\nSituations in remote areas\nwere even more daunting.\n\n\n\n 3:17\n\n\nThis had to change.\nI made this my area of focus.\nI started the design process\nby collecting feedback,\ndeveloping prototypes\nand engaging with various stakeholders\nresearching global protocols.\nWith every single prototype,\nwe went back to the women\nto ensure that we had a product for them.\nWhat I learned through this process\nwas that these women,\ndespite their extreme poverty,\nplaced great value\non their health and well-being.\nThey were absolutely not poor in mind.\nAs with all of us, they would appreciate\na well-designed product\ndeveloped for their needs.\n\n\n\n 3:51\n\n\nAfter many iterations\nworking with experts,\nmedical health professionals\nand the women themselves,\nI should say it was not\nan easy process at all,\nbut we had a simple and beautiful design.\nFor a dollar more than what\nthe existing product was offered for,\nat three dollars, we were able\nto deliver \"janma,\"\na clean birth kit in a purse.\nJanma, meaning \"birth,\" contained\na blood-absorbing sheet\nfor the woman to give birth on,\na surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,\na bar of soap, a pair of gloves\nand the first cloth\nto wipe the baby clean.\nAll this came packaged\nin a beautiful purse\nthat was given to the mother\nas a gift after all her hard work,\nthat she carried home with pride\nas a symbol of prosperity.\n\n\n\n 4:36\n\n\nOne woman reacted to this gift.\nShe said, \"Is this really mine?\nCan I keep it?\"\nThe other one said,\n\"Will you give me a different color\nwhen I have my next baby?\"\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:49\n\n\nBetter yet, a woman expressed\nthat this was the first purse\nthat she had ever owned in her life.\nThe kit, aside from its symbolism\nand its simplicity,\nis designed to follow\nglobally recommended medical protocol\nand serves as a behavior-change tool\nto follow steps one after the other.\nIt can not only be used in homes,\nbut also in institutional settings.\n\n\n\n 5:09\n\n\nTo date, our kit has impacted\nover 600,000 mothers and babies\naround the world.\nIt's a humbling experience\nto watch these numbers grow,\nand I cannot wait until\nwe reach a hundred million.\n\n\n\n 5:23\n\n\nBut women's health issues do not end here.\nThere are thousands of simple issues\nthat require low-cost interventions.\nWe have facts to prove\nthat if we invest in women and girls\nand provide them with better\nhealth and well-being,\nthey will deliver healthier and wealthier\nand prosperous communities.\nWe have to start by bringing simplicity\nand dignity to women's health issues:\nfrom reducing maternal mortality,\nto breaking taboos,\nto empowering women\nto take control of their own lives.\nThis is my dream.\nBut it is not possible to achieve it\nwithout engaging men and women alike\nfrom around the world —\nyes, all of you.\n\n\n\n 6:03\n\n\nI recently heard this lyric\nby Leonard Cohen:\n\"Ring the bells that still can ring.\nForget your perfect offering.\nThere is a crack in everything.\nThat's how the light gets in.\"\n\n\n\n 6:20\n\n\nThis is my bit of light.\nBut we need more light.\nIn fact, we need huge spotlights\nplaced in the world of women's health\nif we need a better tomorrow.\nWe should never forget that women\nare at the center of a sustainable world,\nand we do not exist without them.\n\n\n\n 6:37\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 6:38\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nAn article in the Yale Alumni Magazine\ntold the story of Clyde Murphy,\na black man who was a member\nof the Class of 1970.\nClyde was a success story.\nAfter Yale and a law degree from Columbia,\nClyde spent the next 30 years\nas one of America's\ntop civil rights lawyers.\nHe was also a great husband and father.\nBut despite his success,\npersonally and professionally,\nClyde's story had a sad ending.\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nIn 2010,\nat the age of 62,\nClyde died from a blood clot in his lung.\nClyde's experience was not unique.\nMany of his black classmates from Yale\nalso died young.\nIn fact, the magazine article indicated\nthat 41 years after graduation from Yale,\nthe black members of the Class of 1970\nhad a death rate\nthat was three times higher\nthan that of the average class member.\nIt's stunning.\n\n\n\n 1:32\n\n\nAmerica has recently awakened\nto a steady drumbeat\nof unarmed black men\nbeing shot by the police.\nWhat is even a bigger story\nis that every seven minutes,\na black person dies prematurely\nin the United States.\nThat is over 200 black people\ndie every single day\nwho would not die if the health\nof blacks and whites were equal.\n\n\n\n 2:09\n\n\nFor the last 25 years,\nI have been on a mission\nto understand why does race\nmatter so profoundly for health.\nWhen I started my career,\nmany believed that it was simply\nabout racial differences\nin income and education.\nI discovered that while\neconomic status matters for health,\nthere is more to the story.\nSo for example, if we look\nat life expectancy at age 25,\nat age 25 there's a five-year gap\nbetween blacks and whites.\nAnd the gap by education\nfor both whites and blacks\nis even larger than the racial gap.\nAt the same time,\nat every level of education,\nwhites live longer than blacks.\nSo whites who are high school dropouts\nlive 3.4 years longer\nthan their black counterparts,\nand the gap is even larger\namong college graduates.\nMost surprising of all,\nwhites who have graduated from high school\nlive longer than blacks\nwith a college degree\nor more education.\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\nSo why does race matter\nso profoundly for health?\nWhat else is it\nbeyond education and income\nthat might matter?\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\nIn the early 1990s,\nI was asked to review a new book\non the health of black America.\nI was struck that almost every single one\nof its 25 chapters\nsaid that racism\nwas a factor that was hurting\nthe health of blacks.\nAll of these researchers\nwere stating that racism was a factor\nadversely impacting blacks,\nbut they provided no evidence.\nFor me, that was not good enough.\n\n\n\n 4:12\n\n\nA few months later,\nI was speaking at a conference\nin Washington, DC,\nand I said that one\nof the priorities for research\nwas to document the ways\nin which racism affected health.\nA white gentleman stood in the audience\nand said that while he agreed\nwith me that racism was important,\nwe could never measure racism.\n\"We measure self-esteem,\" I said.\n\"There's no reason\nwhy we can't measure racism\nif we put our minds to it.\"\n\n\n\n 4:44\n\n\nAnd so I put my mind to it\nand developed three scales.\nThe first one captured\nmajor experiences of discrimination,\nlike being unfairly fired\nor being unfairly stopped by the police.\nBut discrimination also occurs\nin more minor and subtle experiences,\nand so my second scale,\ncalled the Everyday Discrimination Scale,\ncaptures nine items\nthat captures experiences\nlike you're treated\nwith less courtesy than others,\nyou receive poorer service\nthan others in restaurants or stores,\nor people act as if they're afraid of you.\nThis scale captures\nways in which the dignity and the respect\nof people who society does not value\nis chipped away on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n 5:32\n\n\nResearch has found\nthat higher levels of discrimination\nare associated with an elevated risk\nof a broad range of diseases\nfrom blood pressure to abdominal obesity\nto breast cancer to heart disease\nand even premature mortality.\nStrikingly, some of the effects\nare observed at a very young age.\nFor example, a study of black teens\nfound that those who reported higher\nlevels of discrimination as teenagers\nhad higher levels of stress hormones,\nof blood pressure\nand of weight at age 20.\nHowever,\nthe stress of discrimination\nis only one aspect.\n\n\n\n 6:31\n\n\nDiscrimination and racism\nalso matters in other\nprofound ways for health.\nFor example, there's\ndiscrimination in medical care.\nIn 1999, the National Academy of Medicine\nasked me to serve on a committee\nthat found, concluded\nbased on the scientific evidence,\nthat blacks and other minorities\nreceive poorer quality care than whites.\nThis was true for all kinds\nof medical treatment,\nfrom the most simple\nto the most technologically sophisticated.\nOne explanation for this pattern\nwas a phenomenon\nthat's called \"implicit bias\"\nor \"unconscious discrimination.\"\nResearch for decades\nby social psychologists\nindicates that if you hold\na negative stereotype\nabout a group in your subconscious mind\nand you meet someone from that group,\nyou will discriminate against that person.\nYou will treat them differently.\nIt's an unconscious process.\nIt's an automatic process.\nIt is a subtle process, but it's normal\nand it occurs even among\nthe most well-intentioned individuals.\n\n\n\n 7:50\n\n\nBut the deeper that I delved\ninto the health impact of racism,\nthe more insidious the effects became.\nThere is institutional discrimination,\nwhich refers to discrimination\nthat exists in the processes\nof social institutions.\nResidential segregation by race,\nwhich has led to blacks and whites living\nin very different neighborhood contexts,\nis a classic example\nof institutional racism.\nOne of America's best-kept secrets\nis how residential segregation\nis the secret source\nthat creates racial inequality\nin the United States.\nIn America, where you live\ndetermines your access to opportunities\nin education, in employment,\nin housing and even\nin access to medical care.\nOne study of the 171 largest\ncities in the United States\nconcluded that there is not even one city\nwhere whites live\nunder equal conditions to blacks,\nand that the worst urban contexts\nin which whites reside\nis considerably better than the average\ncontext of black communities.\nAnother study found\nthat if you could eliminate statistically\nresidential segregation,\nyou would completely erase\nblack-white differences in income,\neducation and unemployment,\nand reduce black-white differences\nin single motherhood\nby two thirds,\nall of that driven by segregation.\nI have also learned\nhow the negative stereotypes\nand images of blacks in our culture\nliterally create and sustain\nboth institutional\nand individual discrimination.\n\n\n\n 9:51\n\n\nA group of researchers\nhave put together a database\nthat contains the books,\nmagazines and articles\nthat an average college-educated\nAmerican would read over their lifetime.\nIt allows us to look within this database\nand see how Americans\nhave seen words paired together\nas they grow up in their society.\nSo when the word \"black\"\nappears in American culture,\nwhat co-occurs with it?\n\"Poor,\"\n\"violent,\"\n\"religious,\"\n\"lazy,\"\n\"cheerful,\"\n\"dangerous.\"\nWhen \"white\" occurs,\nthe frequently co-occurring words\nare \"wealthy,\"\n\"progressive,\"\n\"conventional,\"\n\"stubborn,\"\n\"successful,\"\n\"educated.\"\nSo when a police officer\noverreacts when he sees\nan unarmed black male\nand perceives him\nto be violent and dangerous,\nwe are not necessarily dealing\nwith an inherently bad cop.\nWe may be simply viewing\na normal American\nwho is reflecting\nwhat he has been exposed to\nas a result of being raised\nin this society.\n\n\n\n11:15\n\n\nFrom my own experience,\nI believe that your race\ndoes not have to be\na determinant of your destiny.\nI migrated to the United States\nfrom the Caribbean

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nSo it all came to life\nin a dark bar in Madrid.\nI encountered my colleague\nfrom McGill, Michael Meaney.\nAnd we were drinking a few beers,\nand like scientists do,\nhe told me about his work.\nAnd he told me that he is interested\nin how mother rats lick their pups\nafter they were born.\nAnd I was sitting there and saying,\n\"This is where my tax\ndollars are wasted —\n\n\n\n 0:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:43\n\n\non this kind of soft science.\"\n\n\n\n 0:46\n\n\nAnd he started telling me\nthat the rats, like humans,\nlick their pups in very different ways.\nSome mothers do a lot of that,\nsome mothers do very little,\nand most are in between.\nBut what's interesting about it\nis when he follows these pups\nwhen they become adults —\nlike, years in human life,\nlong after their mother died.\nThey are completely different animals.\nThe animals that were licked\nand groomed heavily,\nthe high-licking and grooming,\nare not stressed.\nThey have different sexual behavior.\nThey have a different way of living\nthan those that were not treated\nas intensively by their mothers.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nSo then I was thinking to myself:\nIs this magic?\nHow does this work?\nAs geneticists would like you to think,\nperhaps the mother had\nthe \"bad mother\" gene\nthat caused her pups to be stressful,\nand then it was passed\nfrom generation to generation;\nit's all determined by genetics.\nOr is it possible that something\nelse is going on here?\n\n\n\n 2:02\n\n\nIn rats, we can ask\nthis question and answer it.\nSo what we did is\na cross-fostering experiment.\nYou essentially separate the litter,\nthe babies of this rat, at birth,\nto two kinds of fostering mothers —\nnot the real mothers,\nbut mothers that will take care of them:\nhigh-licking mothers\nand low-licking mothers.\nAnd you can do the opposite\nwith the low-licking pups.\nAnd the remarkable answer was,\nit wasn't important\nwhat gene you got from your mother.\nIt was not the biological mother\nthat defined this property of these rats.\nIt is the mother that\ntook care of the pups.\nSo how can this work?\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nI am an a epigeneticist.\nI am interested in how genes are marked\nby a chemical mark\nduring embryogenesis, during the time\nwe're in the womb of our mothers,\nand decide which gene will be expressed\nin what tissue.\nDifferent genes are expressed in the brain\nthan in the liver and the eye.\nAnd we thought: Is it possible\nthat the mother is somehow\nreprogramming the gene of her offspring\nthrough her behavior?\nAnd we spent 10 years,\nand we found that there is a cascade\nof biochemical events\nby which the licking and grooming\nof the mother, the care of the mother,\nis translated to biochemical signals\nthat go into the nucleus and into the DNA\nand program it differently.\nSo now the animal can prepare\nitself for life:\nIs life going to be harsh?\nIs there going to be a lot of food?\nAre there going to be a lot of cats\nand snakes around,\nor will I live\nin an upper-class neighborhood\nwhere all I have to do\nis behave well and proper,\nand that will gain me social acceptance?\nAnd now one can think about\nhow important that process can be\nfor our lives.\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\nWe inherit our DNA from our ancestors.\nThe DNA is old.\nIt evolved during evolution.\nBut it doesn't tell us\nif you are going to be born in Stockholm,\nwhere the days are long in the summer\nand short in the winter,\nor in Ecuador,\nwhere there's an equal number of hours\nfor day and night all year round.\nAnd that has such an enormous [effect]\non our physiology.\nSo what we suggest is,\nperhaps what happens early in life,\nthose signals that come\nthrough the mother,\ntell the child what kind of social world\nyou're going to be living in.\nIt will be harsh, and you'd better\nbe anxious and be stressful,\nor it's going to be an easy world,\nand you have to be different.\nIs it going to be a world\nwith a lot of light or little light?\nIs it going to be a world\nwith a lot of food or little food?\nIf there's no food around,\nyou'd better develop your brain to binge\nwhenever you see a meal,\nor store every piece of food\nthat you have as fat.\n\n\n\n 5:07\n\n\nSo this is good.\nEvolution has selected this\nto allow our fixed, old DNA\nto function in a dynamic way\nin new environments.\nBut sometimes things can go wrong;\nfor example, if you're born\nto a poor family\nand the signals are, \"You better binge,\nyou better eat every piece of food\nyou're going to encounter.\"\nBut now we humans\nand our brain have evolved,\nhave changed evolution even faster.\nNow you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.\nAnd therefore, the preparation\nthat we had by our mothers\nis turning out to be maladaptive.\nThe same preparation that was supposed\nto protect us from hunger and famine\nis going to cause obesity,\ncardiovascular problems\nand metabolic disease.\nSo this concept that genes\ncould be marked by our experience,\nand especially the early life experience,\ncan provide us a unifying explanation\nof both health and disease.\n\n\n\n 6:11\n\n\nBut is true only for rats?\nThe problem is, we cannot\ntest this in humans,\nbecause ethically, we cannot administer\nchild adversity in a random way.\nSo if a poor child develops\na certain property,\nwe don't know whether\nthis is caused by poverty\nor whether poor people have bad genes.\nSo geneticists will try to tell you\nthat poor people are poor\nbecause their genes make them poor.\nEpigeneticists will tell you\npoor people are in a bad environment\nor an impoverished environment\nthat creates that phenotype,\nthat property.\n\n\n\n 6:46\n\n\nSo we moved to look\ninto our cousins, the monkeys.\nMy colleague, Stephen Suomi,\nhas been rearing monkeys\nin two different ways:\nrandomly separated the monkey\nfrom the mother\nand reared her with a nurse\nand surrogate motherhood conditions.\nSo these monkeys didn't have\na mother; they had a nurse.\nAnd other monkeys were reared\nwith their normal, natural mothers.\nAnd when they were old,\nthey were completely different animals.\nThe monkeys that had a mother\ndid not care about alcohol,\nthey were not sexually aggressive.\nThe monkeys that didn't have a mother\nwere aggressive, were stressed\nand were alcoholics.\nSo we looked at their DNA\nearly after birth, to see:\nIs it possible that the mother is marking?\nIs there a signature of the mother\nin the DNA of the offspring?\n\n\n\n 7:43\n\n\nThese are Day-14 monkeys,\nand what you see here is the modern way\nby which we study epigenetics.\nWe can now map those chemical marks,\nwhich we call methylation marks,\non DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.\nWe can map the entire genome.\nWe can now compare the monkey\nthat had a mother or not.\nAnd here's a visual presentation of this.\nWhat you see is the genes\nthat got more methylated are red.\nThe genes that got\nless methylated are green.\nYou can see many genes are changing,\nbecause not having a mother\nis not just one thing —\nit affects the whole way;\nit sends signals about the whole way\nyour world is going to look\nwhen you become an adult.\nAnd you can see the two groups of monkeys\nextremely well-separated from each other.\nHow early does this develop?\nThese monkeys already\ndidn't see their mothers,\nso they had a social experience.\nDo we sense our social status,\neven at the moment of birth?\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nSo in this experiment,\nwe took placentas of monkeys\nthat had different social status.\nWhat's interesting about social rank\nis that across all living beings,\nthey will structure\nthemselves by hierarchy.\nMonkey number one is the boss;\nmonkey number four is the peon.\nYou put four monkeys in a cage,\nthere will always be a boss\nand always be a peon.\nAnd what's interesting\nis that the monkey number one\nis much healthier than monkey number four.\nAnd if you put them in a cage,\nmonkey number one will not eat as much.\nMonkey number four will eat [a lot].\nAnd what you see here\nin this methylation mapping,\na dramatic separation at birth\nof the animals that had\na high social status\nversus the animals\nthat did not have a high status.\n\n\n\n 9:38\n\n\nSo we are born already knowing\nthe social information,\nand that social information\nis not bad or good,\nit just prepares us for life,\nbecause we have to program\nour biology differently\nif we are in the high\nor the low social status.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nBut how can you study this in humans?\nWe can't do experiments,\nwe can't administer adversity to humans.\nBut God does experiments with humans,\nand it's called natural disasters.\n\n\n\n10:06\n\n\nOne of the hardest natural disasters\nin Canadian history\nhappened in my province of Quebec.\nIt's the ice storm of 1998.\nWe lost our entire electrical grid\nbecause of an ice storm\nwhen the temperatures\nwere, in the dead of winter in Quebec,\nminus 20 to minus 30.\nAnd there were pregnant\nmothers during that time.\nAnd my colleague Suzanne King\nfollowed the children of these mothers\nfor 15 years.\n\n\n\n10:35\n\n\nAnd what happened was,\nthat as the stress increased —\nand here we had objective\nmeasures of stress:\nHow long were you without power?\nWhere did you spend your time?\nWas it in your mother-in-law's apartment\nor in some posh country home?\nSo all of these added up\nto a social stress scale,\nand you can ask the question:\nHow did the children look?\nAnd it appears that as stress increases,\nthe children develop more autism,\nthey develop more metabolic diseases\nand they develop more autoimmune diseases.\nWe would map the methylation state,\nand again, you see the green genes\nbecoming red as stress increases,\nthe red genes becoming green\nas stress increases,\nan entire rearrangement\nof the genome in response to stress.\n\n\n\n11:28\n\n\nSo if we can program genes,\nif we are not just the slaves\nof the history of our genes,\nthat they could be programmed,\ncan we deprogram them?\nBecause epigenetic causes\ncan cause diseases like cancer,\nmetabolic disease\nand mental health diseases.\n\n\n\n11:49\n\n\nLet's talk about cocaine addiction.\nCocaine addiction is a terrible situation\nthat can lead to death\nand to loss of human life.\nWe asked the question:\nCan we reprogram the addicted brain\nto make that animal not addicted anymore?\nWe used a cocaine addiction model\nthat recapitulates what happens in humans.\nIn humans, you're in high school,\nsome friends suggest you use some cocaine,\nyou take cocaine, nothing happens.\nMonths pass by, something reminds you\nof what happened the first time,\na pusher pushes cocaine,\nand you become addicted\nand your life has changed.\n\n\n\n12:33\n\n\nIn rats, we do the same thing.\nMy colleague, Gal Yadid,\nhe trains the animals\nto get used to cocaine,\nthen for one month, no cocaine.\nThen he reminds them of the party\nwhen they saw the cocaine the first time\nby cue, the colors of the cage\nwhen they saw cocaine.\nAnd they go crazy.\nThey will press the lever to get cocaine\nuntil they die.\nWe first determined that the difference\nbetween these animals\nis that during that time\nwhen nothing happens,\nthere's no cocaine around,\ntheir epigenome is rearranged.\nTheir genes are re-marked\nin a different way,\nand when the cue comes,\ntheir genome is ready\nto develop this addictive phenotype.\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nSo we treated these animals with drugs\nthat either increase DNA methylation,\nwhich was the epigenetic\nmarker to look at,\nor decrease epigenetic markings.\nAnd we found that\nif we increased methylation,\nthese animals go even crazier.\nThey become more craving for cocaine.\nBut if we reduce the DNA methylation,\nthe animals are not addicted anymore.\nWe have reprogrammed them.\nAnd a fundamental difference\nbetween an epigenetic drug\nand any other drug\nis that with epigenetic drugs,\nwe essentially remove\nthe signs of experience,\nand once they're gone,\nthey will not come back\nunless you have the same experience.\nThe animal now is reprogrammed.\nSo when we visited the animals\n30 days, 60 days later,\nwhich is in human terms\nmany years of life,\nthey were still not addicted —\nby a single epigenetic treatment.\n\n\n\n14:15\n\n\nSo what did we learn about DNA?\nDNA is not just a sequence of letters;\nit's not just a script.\nDNA is a dynamic movie.\nOur experiences are being written\ninto this movie, which is interactive.\nYou're, like, watching a movie\nof your life, with the DNA,\nwith your remote control.\nYou can remove an actor and add an actor.\nAnd so you have, in spite\nof the deterministic nature of genetics,\nyou have control of the way\nyour genes look,\nand this has a tremendous\noptimistic message\nfor the ability to now encounter\nsome of the deadly diseases\nlike cancer, mental health,\nwith a new approach,\nlooking at them as maladaptation.\nAnd if we can epigenetically intervene,\n[we can] reverse the movie\nby removing an actor\nand setting up a new narrative.\n\n\n\n15:17\n\n\nSo what I told you today is,\nour DNA is really combined\nof two components,\ntwo layers of information.\nOne layer of information is old,\nevolved from millions\nof years of evolution.\nIt is fixed and very hard to change.\nThe other layer of information\nis the epigenetic layer,\nwhich is open and dynamic\nand sets up a narrative\nthat is interactive,\nthat allows us to control,\nto a large extent, our destiny,\nto help the destiny of our children\nand to hopefully conquer disease\nand serious health challenges\nthat have plagued humankind\nfor a long time.\n\n\n\n16:14\n\n\nSo even though we are determined\nby our genes,\nwe have a degree of freedom\nthat can set up our life\nto a life of responsibility.\n\n\n\n16:26\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:28\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nIn 1956, a documentary\nby Jacques Cousteau won\nboth the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.\nThis film was called,\n\"Le Monde Du Silence,\"\nor, \"The Silent World.\"\nThe premise of the title was that\nthe underwater world was a quiet world.\nWe now know, 60 years later,\nthat the underwater world\nis anything but silent.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nAlthough the sounds\nare inaudible above water\ndepending on where you are\nand the time of year,\nthe underwater soundscape can be as noisy\nas any jungle or rainforest.\nInvertebrates like snapping shrimp,\nfish and marine mammals\nall use sound.\nThey use sound to study their habitat,\nto keep in communication with each other,\nto navigate,\nto detect predators and prey.\nThey also use sound by listening\nto know something about their environment.\n\n\n\n 1:12\n\n\nTake, for an example, the Arctic.\nIt's considered a vast,\ninhospitable place,\nsometimes described as a desert,\nbecause it is so cold and so remote\nand ice-covered for much of the year.\nAnd despite this,\nthere is no place on Earth\nthat I would rather be than the Arctic,\nespecially as days lengthen\nand spring comes.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nTo me, the Arctic really\nembodies this disconnect\nbetween what we see on the surface\nand what's going on underwater.\nYou can look out across the ice —\nall white and blue and cold —\nand see nothing.\nBut if you could hear underwater,\nthe sounds you would hear\nwould at first amaze\nand then delight you.\nAnd while your eyes are seeing\nnothing for kilometers but ice,\nyour ears are telling you that out there\nare bowhead and beluga whales,\nwalrus and bearded seals.\nThe ice, too, makes sounds.\nIt screeches and cracks\nand pops and groans,\nas it collides and rubs when temperature\nor currents or winds change.\nAnd under 100 percent sea ice\nin the dead of winter,\nbowhead whales are singing.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nAnd you would never expect that,\nbecause we humans,\nwe tend to be very visual animals.\nFor most of us, but not all,\nour sense of sight is how\nwe navigate our world.\nFor marine mammals that live underwater,\nwhere chemical cues\nand light transmit poorly,\nsound is the sense by which they see.\nAnd sound transmits very well underwater,\nmuch better than it does in air,\nso signals can be heard\nover great distances.\n\n\n\n 3:07\n\n\nIn the Arctic, this\nis especially important,\nbecause not only do Arctic marine\nmammals have to hear each other,\nbut they also have to listen\nfor cues in the environment\nthat might indicate\nheavy ice ahead or open water.\nRemember, although they spend\nmost of their lives underwater,\nthey are mammals,\nand so they have to surface to breathe.\nSo they might listen\nfor thin ice or no ice,\nor listen for echoes off nearby ice.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nArctic marine mammals live in a rich\nand varied underwater soundscape.\nIn the spring,\nit can be a cacophony of sound.\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\n(Marine mammal sounds)\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\nBut when the ice is frozen solid,\nand there are no big temperature\nshifts or current changes,\nthe underwater Arctic has some\nof the lowest ambient noise levels\nof the world's oceans.\nBut this is changing.\nThis is primarily due to a decrease\nin seasonal sea ice,\nwhich is a direct result of human\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nWe are, in effect, with climate change,\nconducting a completely uncontrolled\nexperiment with our planet.\n\n\n\n 4:34\n\n\nOver the past 30 years,\nareas of the Arctic have seen\ndecreases in seasonal sea ice\nfrom anywhere from\nsix weeks to four months.\nThis decrease in sea ice is sometimes\nreferred to as an increase\nin the open water season.\nThat is the time of year when\nthe Arctic is navigable to vessels.\nAnd not only is the extent\nof ice changing,\nbut the age and the width of ice is, too.\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\nNow, you may well have heard\nthat a decrease in seasonal sea ice\nis causing a loss of habitat\nfor animals that rely on sea ice,\nsuch as ice seals,\nor walrus, or polar bears.\nDecreasing sea ice is also causing\nincreased erosion along coastal villages,\nand changing prey availability\nfor marine birds and mammals.\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nClimate change and decreases in sea ice\nare also altering the underwater\nsoundscape of the Arctic.\nWhat do I mean by soundscape?\nThose of us who eavesdrop\non the oceans for a living\nuse instruments called hydrophones,\nwhich are underwater microphones,\nand we record ambient noise —\nthe noise all around us.\nAnd the soundscape describes\nthe different contributors\nto this noise field.\nWhat we are hearing on our hydrophones\nare the very real sounds\nof climate change.\nWe are hearing these changes\nfrom three fronts:\nfrom the air,\nfrom the water\nand from land.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nFirst: air.\nWind on water creates waves.\nThese waves make bubbles;\nthe bubbles break,\nand when they do,\nthey make noise.\nAnd this noise is like a hiss\nor a static in the background.\nIn the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,\nmost of the noise from wind\ndoesn't make it into the water column,\nbecause the ice acts as a buffer\nbetween the atmosphere and the water.\nThis is one of the reasons\nthat the Arctic can have\nvery low ambient noise levels.\nBut with decreases in seasonal sea ice,\nnot only is the Arctic now open\nto this wave noise,\nbut the number of storms\nand the intensity of storms in the Arctic\nhas been increasing.\nAll of this is raising noise levels\nin a previously quiet ocean.\n\n\n\n 7:01\n\n\nSecond: water.\nWith less seasonal sea ice,\nsubarctic species are moving north,\nand taking advantage of the new habitat\nthat is created by more open water.\nNow, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,\nthey have no dorsal fin,\nbecause they have evolved to live\nand swim in ice-covered waters,\nand having something sticking\noff of your back is not very conducive\nto migrating through ice,\nand may, in fact, be excluding\nanimals from the ice.\nBut now, everywhere we've listened,\nwe're hearing the sounds\nof fin whales and humpback whales\nand killer whales,\nfurther and further north,\nand later and later in the season.\nWe are hearing, in essence,\nan invasion of the Arctic\nby subarctic species.\nAnd we don't know what this means.\nWill there be competition for food\nbetween Arctic and subarctic animals?\nMight these subarctic species introduce\ndiseases or parasites into the Arctic?\nAnd what are the new sounds\nthat they are producing\ndoing to the soundscape underwater?\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nAnd third: land.\nAnd by land ...\nI mean people.\nMore open water means\nincreased human use of the Arctic.\nJust this past summer,\na massive cruise ship made its way\nthrough the Northwest Passage —\nthe once-mythical route\nbetween Europe and the Pacific.\nDecreases in sea ice have allowed\nhumans to occupy the Arctic more often.\nIt has allowed increases in oil\nand gas exploration and extraction,\nthe potential for commercial shipping,\nas well as increased tourism.\nAnd we now know that ship noise increases\nlevels of stress hormones in whales\nand can disrupt feeding behavior.\nAir guns, which produce loud,\nlow-frequency \"whoomps\"\nevery 10 to 20 seconds,\nchanged the swimming and vocal\nbehavior of whales.\nAnd all of these sound sources\nare decreasing the acoustic space\nover which Arctic marine mammals\ncan communicate.\n\n\n\n 9:17\n\n\nNow, Arctic marine mammals\nare used to very high levels of noise\nat certain times of the year.\nBut this is primarily from other\nanimals or from sea ice,\nand these are the sounds\nwith which they've evolved,\nand these are sounds that are vital\nto their very survival.\nThese new sounds\nare loud and they're alien.\nThey might impact the environment\nin ways that we think we understand,\nbut also in ways that we don't.\nRemember, sound is the most\nimportant sense for these animals.\nAnd not only is the physical habitat\nof the Arctic changing rapidly,\nbut the acoustic habitat is, too.\nIt's as if we've plucked these animals up\nfrom the quiet countryside\nand dropped them into a big city\nin the middle of rush hour.\nAnd they can't escape it.\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\nSo what can we do now?\nWe can't decrease wind speeds\nor keep subarctic animals\nfrom migrating north,\nbut we can work on local solutions\nto reducing human-caused underwater noise.\nOne of these solutions\nis to slow down ships\nthat traverse the Arctic,\nbecause a slower ship is a quieter ship.\nWe can restrict access\nin seasons and regions\nthat are important for mating\nor feeding or migrating.\nWe can get smarter about quieting ships\nand find better ways\nto explore the ocean bottom.\nAnd the good news is,\nthere are people\nworking on this right now.\nBut ultimately,\nwe humans have to do the hard work\nof reversing or at the very\nleast decelerating\nhuman-caused atmospheric changes.\n\n\n\n11:08\n\n\nSo, let's return to this idea\nof a silent world underwater.\nIt's entirely possible\nthat many of the whales\nswimming in the Arctic today,\nespecially long-lived species\nlike the bowhead whale\nthat the Inuits say can live\ntwo human lives —\nit's possible that these whales\nwere alive in 1956,\nwhen Jacques Cousteau made his film.\nAnd in retrospect,\nconsidering all the noise\nwe are creating in the oceans today,\nperhaps it really was \"The Silent World.\"\n\n\n\n11:43\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:45\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIt was just an ordinary Saturday.\nMy dad was outside mowing the lawn,\nmy mom was upstairs folding laundry,\nmy sister was in her room doing homework\nand I was in the basement\nplaying video games.\nAnd as I came upstairs\nto get something to drink,\nI looked out the window\nand realized that there was something\nthat I was supposed to be doing,\nand this is what I saw.\n\n\n\n 0:34\n\n\nNo, this wasn't\nmy family's dinner on fire.\nThis was my science project.\nFlames were pouring out,\nsmoke was in the air\nand it looked like our wooden deck\nwas about to catch fire.\nI immediately started yelling.\nMy mom was freaking out,\nmy dad ran around to put out the fire\nand of course my sister\nstarted recording a Snapchat video.\n\n\n\n 0:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\nThis was just the beginning\nof my team's science project.\nMy team is composed of me\nand three other students\nwho are here in the audience today.\nWe competed in FIRST LEGO League\nwhich is an international\nLEGO robotics competition for kids,\nand in addition to a robotics game,\nwe also worked\non a separate science project,\nand this was the project\nthat we were working on.\n\n\n\n 1:19\n\n\nSo the idea for this project all started\nwhen a few months earlier,\na couple of my teammates\ntook a trip to Central America\nand saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,\nor expanded polystyrene foam.\nAnd when they came back\nand told us about it,\nwe really started thinking about the ways\nin which we see Styrofoam every day.\nGet a new flat-screen TV?\nYou end up with a block of Styrofoam\nbigger than the TV itself.\nDrink a cup of coffee?\nWell, those Styrofoam coffee cups\nare sure going to add up.\nAnd where do all these items go\nafter their one-time use?\nSince there aren't any good\nexisting solutions for used Styrofoam,\nalmost all of them\nend up right in the landfill,\nor the oceans and beaches,\ntaking over 500 years to degrade.\nAnd in fact, every year, the US alone\nproduces over two billion\npounds of Styrofoam,\nfilling up a staggering\n25 percent of landfills.\n\n\n\n 2:08\n\n\nSo why do we have these ghost\naccumulations of Styrofoam waste?\nWhy can't we just recycle them\nlike many plastics?\nWell, simply put, recycled\npolystyrene is too expensive\nand potentially contaminated,\nso there is very little market demand\nfor Styrofoam that has to be recycled.\nAnd as a result, Styrofoam\nis considered a nonrenewable material,\nbecause it is neither feasible\nnor viable to recycle polystyrene.\nAnd in fact, many cities across the US\nhave even passed ordinances\nthat simply ban the production\nof many products containing polystyrene,\nwhich includes disposable utensils,\npacking peanuts, takeout containers\nand even plastic beach toys,\nall products that are very useful\nin today's society.\nAnd now France\nhas become the first country\nto completely ban all plastic utensils,\ncups and plates.\n\n\n\n 2:56\n\n\nBut what if we could keep using Styrofoam\nand keep benefiting\nfrom its cheap, lightweight, insulating\nand excellent packing ability,\nwhile not having to suffer\nfrom the repercussions\nof having to dispose of it?\nWhat if we could turn it into\nsomething else that's actually useful?\nWhat if we could make\nthe impossible possible?\n\n\n\n 3:15\n\n\nMy team hypothesized that we could use\nthe carbon that's already in Styrofoam\nto create activated carbon,\nwhich is used in almost\nevery water filter today.\nAnd activated carbon works\nby using very small micropores\nto filter out contaminants\nfrom water or even air.\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\nSo we started out\nby doing a variety of heating tests,\nand unfortunately, we had many failures.\nLiterally, nothing worked.\nBesides my dad's grill catching on fire,\nmost of our samples\nvaporized into nothing,\nor exploded inside expensive furnaces,\nleaving a horribly sticky mess.\nIn fact, we were so saddened\nby our failures that we almost gave up.\n\n\n\n 3:56\n\n\nSo why did we keep trying\nwhen all the adults\nsaid it was impossible?\nWell, maybe it's because we're kids.\nWe don't know any better.\nBut the truth is, we kept trying\nbecause we thought it was still possible.\nWe knew that if we were successful,\nwe would be helping the environment\nand making the world a better place.\nSo we kept trying\nand failing\nand trying\nand failing.\nWe were so ready to give up.\n\n\n\n 4:21\n\n\nBut then it happened.\nWith the right temperatures,\ntimes and chemicals,\nwe finally got that successful test result\nshowing us that we had created\nactivated carbon from Styrofoam waste.\nAnd at that moment,\nthe thing that had been impossible\nall of a sudden wasn't.\nIt showed us that although we had\nmany failures at the beginning,\nwe were able to persevere through them\nto get the test results that we wanted.\nAnd moreover, not only were we able\nto create activated carbon\nfor purifying water,\nbut we were also able\nto reduce Styrofoam waste,\nsolving two global problems\nwith just one solution.\n\n\n\n 4:53\n\n\nSo from then on, we were inspired\nto take our project further,\nperforming more tests\nto make it more effective\nand testing it in real world situations.\nWe then proceeded to receive funding\nfrom the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION\nSTEM-in-Action program\nsponsored by the US Army,\nas well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards\nsponsored by XPRIZE.\nAnd we were also honored\nwith the Scientific American\nInnovator Award\nfrom Google Science Fair.\nAnd using these funds, we plan\nto file a full patent on our process\nand to continue to work on our project.\n\n\n\n 5:23\n\n\nSo yes, although we started\nwith catching my dad's grill on fire\nand failing so many times\nthat we almost quit,\nit was well worth it\nwhen we look back at it now.\nWe took a problem\nthat many people said was impossible\nand we made it possible,\nand we persevered when it looked\nlike nothing that we did would work.\nWe learned that you can't have success\nwithout a little,\nor a lot, of failure.\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\nSo in the future, don't be afraid\nif your grill goes up in flames,\nbecause you never know\nwhen your idea might just catch fire.\n\n\n\n 5:54\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI would like to tell you\nabout the most embarrassing thing\nthat has ever happened to me in my years\nof working as a palliative care physician.\nThis happened a couple of years ago.\nI was asked as a consultant\nto see a woman in her 70s —\nretired English professor\nwho had pancreatic cancer.\nI was asked to see her because\nshe had pain, nausea, vomiting ...\nWhen I went to see her,\nwe talked about those symptoms\nand in the course of that consultation,\nshe asked me whether I thought\nthat medical marijuana might help her.\nI thought back to everything\nthat I had learned in medical school\nabout medical marijuana,\nwhich didn't take very long\nbecause I had learned absolutely nothing.\nAnd so I told her that as far as I knew,\nmedical marijuana\nhad no benefits whatsoever.\nAnd she smiled and nodded and reached\ninto the handbag next to the bed,\nand pulled out a stack of about a dozen\nrandomized controlled trials\nshowing that medical\nmarijuana has benefits\nfor symptoms like nausea\nand pain and anxiety.\nShe handed me those articles and said,\n\"Maybe you should read these\nbefore offering an opinion ...\ndoctor.\"\n\n\n\n 1:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\nSo I did.\nThat night I read all of those articles\nand found a bunch more.\nWhen I came to see her the next morning,\nI had to admit that it looks like\nthere is some evidence\nthat marijuana can offer medical benefits\nand I suggested that if she\nreally was interested,\nshe should try it.\nYou know what she said?\nThis 73-year-old,\nretired English professor?\nShe said, \"I did try it\nabout six months ago.\nIt was amazing.\nI've been using it every day since.\nIt's the best drug I've discovered.\nI don't know why it took me 73 years\nto discover this stuff. It's amazing.\"\n\n\n\n 2:10\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\nThat was the moment at which I realized\nI needed to learn something\nabout medical marijuana\nbecause what I was prepared for\nin medical school\nbore no relationship to reality.\n\n\n\n 2:22\n\n\nSo I started reading more articles,\nI started talking to researchers,\nI started talking to doctors,\nand most importantly,\nI started listening to patients.\nI ended up writing a book\nbased on those conversations,\nand that book really revolved\naround three surprises —\nsurprises to me, anyway.\nOne I already alluded to —\nthat there really are some benefits\nto medical marijuana.\nThose benefits may not be\nas huge or as stunning\nas some of the most avid proponents\nof medical marijuana\nwould have us believe,\nbut they are real.\nSurprise number two:\nmedical marijuana does have some risks.\nThose risks may not be\nas huge and as scary\nas some of the opponents of medical\nmarijuana would have us believe,\nbut they are real risks, nonetheless.\nBut it was the third surprise\nthat was most ...\nsurprising.\nAnd that is that a lot\nof the patients I talked with\nwho've turned to medical\nmarijuana for help,\nweren't turning to medical marijuana\nbecause of its benefits\nor the balance of risks and benefits,\nor because they thought\nit was a wonder drug,\nbut because it gave them\ncontrol over their illness.\nIt let them manage their health\nin a way that was productive and efficient\nand effective and comfortable for them.\n\n\n\n 3:37\n\n\nTo show you what I mean,\nlet me tell you about another patient.\nRobin was in her early 40s when I met her.\nShe looked though\nlike she was in her late 60s.\nShe had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis\nfor the last 20 years,\nher hands were gnarled by arthritis,\nher spine was crooked,\nshe had to rely\non a wheelchair to get around.\nShe looked weak and frail,\nand I guess physically she probably was,\nbut emotionally,\ncognitively, psychologically,\nshe was among the toughest\npeople I've ever met.\nAnd when I sat down next to her\nin a medical marijuana dispensary\nin Northern California\nto ask her about why she turned\nto medical marijuana,\nwhat it did for her and how it helped her,\nshe started out by telling me things\nthat I had heard\nfrom many patients before.\nIt helped with her anxiety;\nit helped with her pain;\nwhen her pain was better,\nshe slept better.\nAnd I'd heard all that before.\nBut then she said something\nthat I'd never heard before,\nand that is that it gave her\ncontrol over her life\nand over her health.\nShe could use it when she wanted,\nin the way that she wanted,\nat the dose and frequency\nthat worked for her.\nAnd if it didn't work for her,\nthen she could make changes.\nEverything was up to her.\nThe most important thing she said\nwas she didn't need\nanybody else's permission —\nnot a clinic appointment,\nnot a doctor's prescription,\nnot a pharmacist's order.\nIt was all up to her.\nShe was in control.\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\nAnd if that seems like a little thing\nfor somebody with chronic illness,\nit's not — not at all.\nWhen we face a chronic serious illness,\nwhether it's rheumatoid arthritis\nor lupus or cancer or diabetes,\nor cirrhosis,\nwe lose control.\nAnd note what I said: \"when,\" not \"if.\"\nAll of us at some point in our lives\nwill face a chronic serious illness\nthat causes us to lose control.\nWe'll see our function decline,\nsome of us will see our cognition decline,\nwe'll be no longer able\nto care for ourselves,\nto do the things that we want to do.\nOur bodies will betray us,\nand in that process, we'll lose control.\nAnd that's scary.\nNot just scary — that's frightening,\nit's terrifying.\nWhen I talk to my patients,\nmy palliative care patients,\nmany of whom are facing illnesses\nthat will end their lives,\nthey have a lot of be frightened of —\npain, nausea, vomiting,\nconstipation, fatigue,\ntheir impending mortality.\nBut what scares them\nmore than anything else\nis this possibility that at some point,\ntomorrow or a month from now,\nthey're going to lose\ncontrol of their health,\nof their lives,\nof their healthcare,\nand they're going to become\ndependent on others,\nand that's terrifying.\n\n\n\n 6:17\n\n\nSo it's no wonder really\nthat patients like Robin,\nwho I just told you about,\nwho I met in that clinic,\nturn to medical marijuana\nto try to claw back\nsome semblance of control.\nHow do they do it though?\nHow do these medical\nmarijuana dispensaries —\nlike the one where I met Robin —\nhow do they give patients like Robin\nback the sort of control that they need?\nAnd how do they do it\nin a way that mainstream\nmedical hospitals and clinics,\nat least for Robin, weren't able to?\nWhat's their secret?\nSo I decided to find out.\n\n\n\n 6:54\n\n\nI went to a seedy clinic\nin Venice Beach in California\nand got a recommendation\nthat would allow me\nto be a medical marijuana patient.\nI got a letter of recommendation\nthat would let me buy medical marijuana.\nI got that recommendation illegally,\nbecause I'm not\na resident of California —\nI should note that.\nI should also note, for the record,\nthat I never used that letter\nof recommendation to make a purchase,\nand to all of you DEA agents out there —\n\n\n\n 7:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:22\n\n\nlove the work that you're doing,\nkeep it up.\n\n\n\n 7:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:26\n\n\nEven though it didn't let me\nmake a purchase though,\nthat letter was priceless\nbecause it let me be a patient.\nIt let me experience\nwhat patients like Robin experience\nwhen they go to a medical\nmarijuana dispensary.\nAnd what I experienced —\nwhat they experience every day,\nhundreds of thousands\nof people like Robin —\nwas really amazing.\nI walked into the clinic,\nand from the moment that I entered\nmany of these clinics and dispensaries,\nI felt like that dispensary, that clinic,\nwas there for me.\nThere were questions\nat the outset about who I am,\nwhat kind of work I do,\nwhat my goals are in looking\nfor a medical marijuana prescription,\nor product,\nwhat my goals are,\nwhat my preferences are,\nwhat my hopes are,\nhow do I think, how do I hope\nthis might help me,\nwhat am I afraid of.\nThese are the sorts of questions\nthat patients like Robin\nget asked all the time.\nThese are the sorts of questions\nthat make me confident\nthat the person I'm talking with\nreally has my best interests at heart\nand wants to get to know me.\n\n\n\n 8:33\n\n\nThe second thing I learned\nin those clinics\nis the availability of education.\nEducation from the folks\nbehind the counter,\nbut also education\nfrom folks in the waiting room.\nPeople I met were more than happy,\nas I was sitting next to them —\npeople like Robin —\nto tell me about who they are,\nwhy they use medical marijuana,\nwhat helps them, how it helps them,\nand to give me advice and suggestions.\nThose waiting rooms really are\na hive of interaction, advice and support.\n\n\n\n 9:03\n\n\nAnd third, the folks behind the counter.\nI was amazed at how willing\nthose people were\nto spend sometimes an hour or more\ntalking me through the nuances\nof this strain versus that strain,\nsmoking versus vaporizing,\nedibles versus tinctures —\nall, remember, without me\nmaking any purchase whatsoever.\nThink about the last time\nyou went to any hospital or clinic\nand the last time anybody spent an hour\nexplaining those sorts of things to you.\nThe fact that patients like Robin\nare going to these clinics,\nare going to these dispensaries\nand getting that sort\nof personalized attention\nand education and service,\nreally should be a wake-up call\nto the healthcare system.\nPeople like Robin are turning away\nfrom mainstream medicine,\nturning to medical marijuana dispensaries\nbecause those dispensaries\nare giving them what they need.\n\n\n\n 9:57\n\n\nIf that's a wake-up call\nto the medical establishment,\nit's a wake-up call that many\nof my colleagues are either not hearing\nor not wanting to hear.\nWhen I talk to my colleagues,\nphysicians in particular,\nabout medical marijuana,\nthey say, \"Oh, we need more evidence.\nWe need more research into benefits,\nwe need more evidence about risks.\"\nAnd you know what? They're right.\nThey're absolutely right.\nWe do need much more evidence\nabout the benefits of medical marijuana.\nWe also need to ask the federal government\nto reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,\nor to deschedule it entirely\nto make that research possible.\nWe also need more research\ninto medical marijuana's risks.\nMedical marijuana's risks —\nwe know a lot about\nthe risks of recreational use,\nwe know next to nothing\nabout the risks of medical marijuana.\nSo we absolutely do need research,\nbut to say that we need research\nand not that we need\nto make any changes now\nis to miss the point entirely.\nPeople like Robin\naren't seeking out medical marijuana\nbecause they think it's a wonder drug,\nor because they think\nit's entirely risk-free.\nThey seek it out because the context\nin which it's delivered and administered\nand used,\ngives them the sort of control\nthey need over their lives.\nAnd that's a wake-up call\nwe really need to pay attention to.\n\n\n\n11:16\n\n\nThe good news though is that\nthere are lessons we can learn today\nfrom those medical marijuana dispensaries.\nAnd those are lessons\nwe really should learn.\nThese are often small,\nmom-and-pop operations\nrun by people with no medical training.\nAnd while it's embarrassing to think\nthat many of these clinics\nand dispensaries are providing services\nand support and meeting patients' needs\nin ways that billion-dollar\nhealthcare systems aren't —\nwe should be embarrassed by that —\nbut we can also learn from that.\nAnd there are probably\nthree lessons at least\nthat we can learn\nfrom those small dispensaries.\n\n\n\n11:51\n\n\nOne: we need to find ways\nto give patients more control\nin small but important ways.\nHow to interact with healthcare providers,\nwhen to interact\nwith healthcare providers,\nhow to use medications\nin ways that work for them.\nIn my own practice,\nI've gotten much more\ncreative and flexible\nin supporting my patients\nin using drugs safely\nto manage their symptoms —\nwith the emphasis on safely.\nMany of the drugs I prescribe\nare drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines\nwhich can be dangerous if overused.\nBut here's the point.\nThey can be dangerous if they're overused,\nbut they can also be ineffective\nif they're not used in a way\nthat's consistent with\nwhat patients want and need.\nSo that flexibility,\nif it's delivered safely,\ncan be extraordinarily valuable\nfor patients and their families.\nThat's number one.\n\n\n\n12:39\n\n\nNumber two: education.\nHuge opportunities\nto learn from some of the tricks\nof those medical marijuana dispensaries\nto provide more education\nthat doesn't require\na lot of physician time necessarily,\nor any physician time,\nbut opportunities to learn\nabout what medications we're using\nand why,\nprognoses, trajectories of illness,\nand most importantly,\nopportunities for patients\nto learn from each other.\nHow can we replicate what goes on\nin those clinic and medical\ndispensary waiting rooms?\nHow patients learn from each other,\nhow people share with each other.\n\n\n\n13:13\n\n\nAnd last but not least,\nputting patients first the way\nthose medical marijuana dispensaries do,\nmaking patients feel\nlegitimately like what they want,\nwhat they need,\nis why, as healthcare providers,\nwe're here.\nAsking patients about their hopes,\ntheir fears, their goals and preferences.\nAs a palliative care provider,\nI ask all my patients what they're\nhoping for and what they're afraid of.\nBut here's the thing.\nPatients shouldn't have to wait\nuntil they're chronically seriously ill,\noften near the end of life,\nthey shouldn't have to wait\nuntil they're seeing a physician like me\nbefore somebody asks them,\n\"What are you hoping for?\"\n\"What are you afraid of?\"\nThat should be baked into the way\nthat healthcare is delivered.\n\n\n\n13:58\n\n\nWe can do this —\nwe really can.\nMedical marijuana dispensaries\nand clinics all across the country\nare figuring this out.\nThey're figuring this out\nin ways that larger, more mainstream\nhealth systems are years behind.\nBut we can learn from them,\nand we have to learn from them.\nAll we have to do is swallow our pride —\nput aside the thought for a minute\nthat because we have\nlots of letters after our name,\nbecause we're experts,\nbecause we're chief medical officers\nof a large healthcare system,\nwe know all there is to know\nabout how to meet patients' needs.\n\n\n\n14:31\n\n\nWe need to swallow our pride.\nWe need to go visit\na few medical marijuana dispensaries.\nWe need to figure out what they're doing.\nWe need to figure out\nwhy so many patients like Robin\nare leaving our mainstream medical clinics\nand going to these medical\nmarijuana dispensaries instead.\nWe need to figure out\nwhat their tricks are,\nwhat their tools are,\nand we need to learn from them.\nIf we do,\nand I think we can,\nand I absolutely think we have to,\nwe can guarantee all of our patients\nwill have a much better experience.\n\n\n\n15:00\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:01\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:13\n\n\nThank you. I have to tell you\nI'm both challenged and excited.\nMy excitement is: I get a chance\nto give something back.\nMy challenge is: the shortest seminar\nI usually do is 50 hours.\n\n\n\n 0:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:24\n\n\nI'm not exaggerating. I do weekends —\nI do more, obviously,\nI also coach people —\nbut I'm into immersion,\nbecause how did you learn language?\nNot just by learning principles,\nyou got in it and you did it\nso often that it became real.\n\n\n\n 0:36\n\n\nThe bottom line of why I'm here,\nbesides being a crazy mofo, is that —\nI'm not here to motivate you,\nyou don't need that, obviously.\nOften that's what people think I do,\nand it's the furthest thing from it.\nWhat happens, though, is people say to me,\n\"I don't need any motivation.\"\nBut that's not what I do.\nI'm the \"why\" guy.\nI want to know why you do what you do.\n\n\n\n 0:56\n\n\nWhat is your motive for action?\nWhat is it that drives you\nin your life today? Not 10 years ago.\nAre you running the same pattern?\nBecause I believe that the invisible force\nof internal drive, activated,\nis the most important thing.\nI'm here because I believe\nemotion is the force of life.\nAll of us here have great minds.\nMost of us here have great minds, right?\nWe all know how to think.\nWith our minds we can\nrationalize anything.\nWe can make anything happen.\n\n\n\n 1:23\n\n\nI agree with what was described\na few days ago,\nthat people work in their self-interest.\nBut we know that that's bullshit at times.\nYou don't work in your\nself-interest all the time,\nbecause when emotion comes into it,\nthe wiring changes\nin the way it functions.\nSo it's wonderful to think intellectually\nabout how the life of the world is,\nespecially those who are very smart\ncan play this game in our head.\nBut I really want to know\nwhat's driving you.\n\n\n\n 1:47\n\n\nWhat I would like to invite you to do\nby the end of this talk is explore\nwhere you are today, for two reasons.\nOne: so that you can contribute more.\nAnd two: that hopefully we can not just\nunderstand other people more,\nbut appreciate them more,\nand create the kinds of connections\nthat can stop some of the challenges\nthat we face today.\nThey're only going to get magnified\nby the very technology that connects us,\nbecause it's making us intersect.\nThat intersection\ndoesn't always create a view\nof \"everybody now understands everybody,\nand everybody appreciates everybody.\"\n\n\n\n 2:15\n\n\nI've had an obsession\nbasically for 30 years,\n\"What makes the difference\nin the quality of people's lives?\nWhat in their performance?\"\nI got hired to produce the result now.\nI've done it for 30 years.\nI get the phone call\nwhen the athlete is burning down\non national television,\nand they were ahead by five strokes\nand now they can't get back on the course.\nI've got to do something right now\nor nothing matters.\nI get the phone call when the child\nis going to commit suicide,\nI've got to do something.\nIn 29 years, I'm very grateful\nto tell you I've never lost one.\nIt doesn't mean I won't some day,\nbut I haven't yet.\nThe reason is an understanding\nof these human needs.\n\n\n\n 2:52\n\n\nWhen I get those calls\nabout performance, that's one thing.\nHow do you make a change?\nI'm also looking to see what is shaping\nthe person's ability to contribute,\nto do something beyond themselves.\nMaybe the real question is,\nI look at life and say\nthere's two master lessons.\nOne is: there's the science\nof achievement,\nwhich almost everyone here\nhas mastered amazingly.\n\"How do you take the invisible\nand make it visible,\"\nHow do you make your dreams happen?\nYour business, your contribution\nto society, money —\nwhatever, your body, your family.\n\n\n\n 3:23\n\n\nThe other lesson that is rarely\nmastered is the art of fulfillment.\nBecause science is easy, right?\nWe know the rules, you write the code\nand you get the results.\nOnce you know the game,\nyou just up the ante, don't you?\nBut when it comes\nto fulfillment — that's an art.\nThe reason is, it's about\nappreciation and contribution.\nYou can only feel so much by yourself.\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\nI've had an interesting laboratory\nto try to answer the real question\nhow somebody's life changes\nif you look at them like those people\nthat you've given everything to?\nLike all the resources they say they need.\nYou gave not a 100-dollar computer,\nbut the best computer.\nYou gave them love, joy,\nwere there to comfort them.\nThose people very often —\nyou know some of them —\nend up the rest of their life\nwith all this love, education,\nmoney and background\ngoing in and out of rehab.\nSome people have been\nthrough ultimate pain,\npsychologically, sexually,\nspiritually, emotionally abused —\nand not always, but often,\nthey become some of the people\nthat contribute the most to society.\n\n\n\n 4:19\n\n\nThe question we've got to ask\nourselves really is, what is it?\nWhat is it that shapes us?\nWe live in a therapy culture.\nMost of us don't do that,\nbut the culture's a therapy culture,\nthe mindset that we are our past.\nAnd you wouldn't be in this room\nif you bought that,\nbut most of society\nthinks biography is destiny.\nThe past equals the future.\nOf course it does if you live there.\nBut what we know and what\nwe have to remind ourselves —\nbecause you can know\nsomething intellectually\nand then not use it, not apply it.\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\nWe've got to remind ourselves\nthat decision is the ultimate power.\nWhen you ask people,\nhave you failed to achieve\nsomething significant in your life?\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\nTR: Thanks for the interaction\non a high level there.\nBut if you ask people,\nwhy didn't you achieve something?\nSomebody who's working for you,\nor a partner, or even yourself.\nWhen you fail to achieve,\nwhat's the reason people say?\nWhat do they tell you?\nDidn't have the knowledge,\ndidn't have the money,\ndidn't have the time,\ndidn't have the technology.\nI didn't have the right manager.\n\n\n\n 5:24\n\n\nAl Gore: Supreme Court.\nTR: The Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n 5:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\n(Applause) (Cheering)\n\n\n\n 5:41\n\n\n(Applause continues)\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\nTR: And —\n\n\n\n 5:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\nWhat do all those, including\nthe Supreme Court, have in common?\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:51\n\n\nThey are a claim to you missing\nresources, and they may be accurate.\nYou may not have the money,\nor the Supreme Court,\nbut that is not the defining factor.\n\n\n\n 6:01\n\n\n(Applause) (Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:07\n\n\nAnd you correct me if I'm wrong.\nThe defining factor is never resources;\nit's resourcefulness.\nAnd what I mean specifically,\nrather than just some phrase,\nis if you have emotion, human emotion,\nsomething that I experienced from you\nthe day before yesterday\nat a level that is as profound\nas I've ever experienced\nand I believe with that emotion\nyou would have beat his ass and won.\n\n\n\n 6:28\n\n\nAudience: Yeah!\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\n(Applause) (Cheering)\n\n\n\n 6:34\n\n\nHow easy for me to tell him\nwhat he should do.\n\n\n\n 6:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:39\n\n\nIdiot, Robbins.\nBut I know when we watched\nthe debate at that time,\nthere were emotions\nthat blocked people's ability\nto get this man's intellect and capacity.\nAnd the way that it came across\nto some people on that day —\nbecause I know people that wanted\nto vote in your direction and didn't,\nand I was upset.\nBut there was emotion there.\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n\n\n 7:02\n\n\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n\n\n 7:03\n\n\nTR: So, emotion is it.\nAnd if we get the right emotion,\nwe can get ourselves to do anything.\nIf you're creative, playful, fun enough,\ncan you get through to anybody, yes or no?\n\n\n\n 7:12\n\n\nIf you don't have the money,\nbut you're creative and determined,\nyou find the way.\nThis is the ultimate resource.\nBut this is not the story\nthat people tell us.\nThey tell us a bunch of different stories.\nThey tell us we don't have\nthe resources, but ultimately,\nif you take a look here,\nthey say, what are all the reasons\nthey haven't accomplished that?\nHe's broken my pattern,\nthat son-of-a-bitch.\n\n\n\n 7:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:35\n\n\nBut I appreciated the energy,\nI'll tell you that.\n\n\n\n 7:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:39\n\n\nWhat determines your resources?\nWe've said decisions shape destiny,\nwhich is my focus here.\nIf decisions shape destiny,\nwhat determines it is three decisions.\nWhat will you focus on?\nYou have to decide\nwhat you're going to focus on.\nConsciously or unconsciously.\nthe minute you decide to focus,\nyou must give it a meaning,\nand that meaning produces emotion.\nIs this the end or the beginning?\nIs God punishing me or rewarding me,\nor is this the roll of the dice?\nAn emotion creates\nwhat we're going to do, or the action.\n\n\n\n 8:06\n\n\nSo, think about your own life,\nthe decisions that\nhave shaped your destiny.\nAnd that sounds really heavy,\nbut in the last five or 10 years,\nhave there been some decisions\nthat if you'd made a different decision,\nyour life would be completely different?\nHow many can think about it?\nBetter or worse. Say, \"Aye.\"\n\n\n\n 8:21\n\n\nAudience: Aye.\n\n\n\n 8:22\n\n\nSo the bottom line is,\nmaybe it was where to go to work,\nand you met the love of your life there,\na career decision.\nI know the Google geniuses I saw here —\nI mean, I understand that their decision\nwas to sell their technology.\nWhat if they made that decision\nversus to build their own culture?\nHow would the world or their lives\nbe different, their impact?\nThe history of our world\nis these decisions.\nWhen a woman stands up and says,\n\"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\"\nShe didn't just affect her life.\nThat decision shaped our culture.\nOr someone standing in front of a tank.\nOr being in a position\nlike Lance Armstrong,\n\"You've got testicular cancer.\"\nThat's pretty tough for any male,\nespecially if you ride a bike.\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\nYou've got it in your brain;\nyou've got it in your lungs.\nBut what was his decision\nof what to focus on?\nDifferent than most people.\nWhat did it mean?\nIt wasn't the end; it was the beginning.\nHe goes off and wins\nseven championships he never once won\nbefore the cancer, because he got\nemotional fitness, psychological strength.\nThat's the difference\nin human beings that I've seen\nof the three million I've been around.\n\n\n\n 9:20\n\n\nIn my lab, I've had three million people\nfrom 80 countries over the last 29 years.\nAnd after a while,\npatterns become obvious.\nYou see that South America and Africa\nmay be connected in a certain way, right?\nOthers say, \"Oh, that sounds\nridiculous.\" It's simple.\nSo, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?\nTwo invisible forces.\nVery quickly. One: state.\nWe all have had times,\nyou did something, and after,\nyou thought to yourself,\n\"I can't believe I said or did that,\nthat was so stupid.\"\nWho's been there? Say, \"Aye.\"\nAudience: Aye.\n\n\n\n 9:51\n\n\nOr after you did something,\nyou go, \"That was me!\"\n\n\n\n 9:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nIt wasn't your ability; it was your state.\nYour model of the world\nis what shapes you long term.\nYour model of the world is the filter.\nThat's what's shaping us.\nIt makes people make decisions.\nTo influence somebody, we need to know\nwhat already influences them.\nIt's made up of three parts.\nFirst, what's your target?\nWhat are you after?\nIt's not your desires.\nYou can get your desires or goals.\nWho has ever got a goal or desire\nand thought, is this all there is?\n\n\n\n10:19\n\n\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n\n\n10:21\n\n\nIt's needs we have. I believe\nthere are six human needs.\nSecond, once you know what the target\nthat's driving you is\nand you uncover it for the truth —\nyou don't form it —\nthen you find out what's your map,\nwhat's the belief systems\nthat tell you how to get those needs.\nSome people think the way\nto get them is to destroy the world,\nsome people, to build,\ncreate something, love someone.\nThere's the fuel you pick.\nSo very quickly, six needs.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\n\nLet me tell you what they are.\nFirst one: certainty.\nThese are not goals or desires,\nthese are universal.\nEveryone needs certainty\nthey can avoid pain\nand at least be comfortable.\nNow, how do you get it?\nControl everybody? Develop a skill?\nGive up? Smoke a cigarette?\nAnd if you got totally\ncertain, ironically,\neven though we need that —\nyou're not certain about your health,\nor your children, or money.\nIf you're not sure\nthe ceiling will hold up,\nyou won't listen to any speaker.\nWhile we go for certainty differently,\nif we get total certainty, we get what?\nWhat do you feel if you're certain?\nYou know what will happen,\nwhen and how it will happen,\nwhat would you feel?\nBored out of your minds.\nSo, God, in Her infinite wisdom,\ngave us a second human need,\nwhich is uncertainty.\nWe need variety. We need surprise.\nHow many of you here\nlove surprises? Say, \"Aye.\"\n\n\n\n11:26\n\n\nAudience: Aye.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nTR: Bullshit. You like\nthe surprises you want.\nThe ones you don't want,\nyou call problems, but you need them.\nSo, variety is important.\nHave you ever rented a video\nor a film that you've already seen?\nWho's done this? Get a fucking life.\n\n\n\n11:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:42\n\n\nWhy are you doing it?\nYou're certain it's good\nbecause you read or saw it before,\nbut you're hoping it's been\nlong enough you've forgotten,\nand there's variety.\n\n\n\n11:50\n\n\nThird human need, critical: significance.\nWe all need to feel important,\nspecial, unique.\nYou can get it by making more money\nor being more spiritual.\nYou can do it by getting yourself\nin a situation where you put\nmore tattoos and earrings in places\nhumans don't want to know.\nWhatever it takes.\nThe fastest way to do this,\nif you have no background,\nno culture, no belief and resources\nor resourcefulness, is violence.\nIf I put a gun to your head and I live\nin the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.\nZero to 10. How high? 10.\nHow certain am I that\nyou're going to respond to me? 10.\nHow much uncertainty?\nWho knows what's going to happen next?\nKind of exciting.\nLike climbing up into a cave\nand doing that stuff\nall the way down there.\nTotal variety and uncertainty.\nAnd it's significant, isn't it?\nSo you want to risk your life for it.\nSo that's why violence has always\nbeen around and will be around\nunless we have a consciousness\nchange as a species.\nYou can get significance a million ways,\nbut to be significant, you've got\nto be unique and different.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\nHere's what we really need:\nconnection and love, fourth need.\nWe all want it;\nmost settle for connection,\nlove's too scary.\nWho here has been hurt\nin an intimate relationship?\nIf you don't raise your hand,\nyou've had other shit, too.\nAnd you're going to get hurt again.\nAren't you glad you came\nto this positive visit?\nHere's what's true: we need it.\nWe can do it through\nintimacy, friendship, prayer,\nthrough walking in nature.\nIf nothing else works for you,\ndon't get a cat, get a dog,\nbecause if you leave for two minutes,\nit's like you've been gone six months,\nwhen you come back 5 minutes later.\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\nThese first four needs,\nevery human finds a way to meet.\nEven if you lie to yourself,\nyou need to have split personalities.\nI call the first four needs\nthe needs of the personality.\nThe last two are the needs of the spirit.\nAnd this is where fulfillment comes.\nYou won't get it from the first four.\nYou'll figure a way, smoke, drink,\ndo whatever, meet the first four.\nBut number five, you must grow.\nWe all know the answer.\nIf you don't grow, you're what?\nIf a relationship or business\nis not growing,\nif you're not growing,\ndoesn't matter how much\nmoney or friends you have,\nhow many love you,\nyou feel like hell.\nAnd I believe the reason we grow\nis so we have something to give of value.\n\n\n\n13:48\n\n\nBecause the sixth need\nis to contribute beyond ourselves.\nBecause we all know, corny as that sounds,\nthe secret to living is giving.\nWe all know life is not about me,\nit's about we.\nThis culture knows that,\nthis room knows that.\nIt's exciting.\nWhen you see Nicholas\ntalking about his $100 computer,\nthe most exciting thing is:\nhere's a genius,\nbut he's got a calling now.\nYou can feel the difference in him,\nand it's beautiful.\nAnd that calling can touch other people.\n\n\n\n14:11\n\n\nMy life was touched\nbecause when I was 11 years old,\nThanksgiving, no money, no food,\nwe were not going to starve,\nbut my father was totally messed up,\nmy mom was letting him know\nhow bad he messed up,\nand somebody came to the door\nand delivered food.\nMy father made three decisions,\nI know what they were, briefly.\nHis focus was \"This is charity.\nWhat does it mean? I'm worthless.\nWhat do I have to do?\nLeave my family,\" which he did.\nIt was one of the most painful\nexperiences of life.\nMy three decisions\ngave me a different path.\nI set focus on \"There's food.\"\nWhat a concept!\n\n\n\n14:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:43\n\n\nBut this is what changed my life,\nshaped me as a human being.\nSomebody's gift,\nI don't even know who it is.\nMy father always said,\n\"No one gives a shit.\"\nAnd now somebody I don't know,\nthey're not asking for anything,\njust giving us food,\nlooking out for us.\nIt made me believe this:\nthat strangers care.\nAnd that made me decide,\nif strangers care about me and my family,\nI care about them.\nI'm going to do something\nto make a difference.\nSo when I was 17,\nI went out on Thanksgiving,\nit was my target for years to have\nenough money to feed two families.\nThe most fun and moving thing\nI ever did in my life.\nNext year, I did four, then eight.\nI didn't tell anybody what I was doing,\nI wasn't doing it for brownie points.\nBut after eight,\nI thought I could use some help.\n\n\n\n15:22\n\n\nSo I went out, got my friends involved,\nthen I grew companies, got 11,\nand I built the foundation.\n18 years later,\nI'm proud to tell you last year we fed\n2 million people in 35 countries\nthrough our foundation.\nAll during the holidays,\nThanksgiving, Christmas,\nin different countries around the world.\n\n\n\n15:38\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:40\n\n\nThank you.\nI don't tell you that to brag,\nbut because I'm proud of human beings\nbecause they get excited to contribute\nonce they've had the chance\nto experience it, not talk about it.\n\n\n\n15:49\n\n\nSo, finally — I'm about out of time.\nThe target that shapes you —\nHere's what's different about people.\nWe have the same needs.\nBut are you a certainty freak,\nis that what you value most,\nor uncertainty?\nThis man couldn't be a certainty freak\nif he climbed through those caves.\nAre you driven by significance or love?\nWe all need all six,\nbut what your lead system is\ntilts you in a different direction.\nAnd as you move in a direction,\nyou have a destination or destiny.\nThe second piece is the map.\nThe operating system\ntells you how to get there,\nand some people's map is,\n\"I'm going to save lives\neven if I die for other people,\"\nand they're a fireman,\nand somebody else says,\n\"I'm going to kill people to do it.\"\nThey're trying to meet\nthe same needs of significance.\nThey want to honor God\nor honor their family.\nBut they have a different map.\n\n\n\n16:33\n\n\nAnd there are seven different beliefs;\nI can't go through them, because I'm done.\nThe last piece is emotion.\nOne of the parts of the map is like time.\nSome people's idea\nof a long time is 100 years.\nSomebody else's is three seconds,\nwhich is what I have.\nAnd the last one I've already mentioned\nthat fell to you.\nIf you've got a target and a map —\nI can't use Google because I love Macs,\nand they haven't made it\ngood for Macs yet.\nSo if you use MapQuest —\nhow many have made\nthis fatal mistake of using it?\nYou use this thing\nand you don't get there.\nImagine if your beliefs guarantee\nyou can never get to where you want to go.\n\n\n\n17:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n17:04\n\n\nThe last thing is emotion.\nHere's what I'll tell you about emotion.\nThere are 6,000 emotions\nthat we have words for\nin the English language,\nwhich is just a linguistic representation\nthat changes by language.\nBut if your dominant emotions —\nIf I have 20,000 people or 1,000\nand I have them write down\nall the emotions that they experience\nin an average week,\nand I give them as long as they need,\nand on one side\nthey write empowering emotions,\nthe other's disempowering,\nguess how many emotions\nthey experience? Less than 12.\nAnd half of those\nmake them feel like shit.\nThey have six good feelings.\nHappy, happy, excited, oh shit,\nfrustrated, frustrated,\noverwhelmed, depressed.\nHow many of you know somebody\nwho, no matter what happens,\nfinds a way to get pissed off?\n\n\n\n17:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n17:45\n\n\nOr no matter what happens,\nthey find a way to be happy or excited.\nHow many of you know somebody like this?\n\n\n\n17:51\n\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, I'll finish\nwith this, I was in Hawaii.\nI was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,\nwe were translating\nfour languages simultaneously\nfor a program I was conducting,\nfor a week.\nThe night before was called\nEmotional Mastery.\nI got up, had no plan\nfor this, and I said —\nwe had fireworks,\nI do crazy shit, fun stuff,\nand at the end, I stopped.\nI had this plan, but I never know\nwhat I'm going to say.\nAnd all of a sudden, I said,\n\"When do people really start to live?\nWhen they face death.\"\nAnd I went through this whole thing\nabout, if you weren't going\nto get off this island,\nif nine days from now,\nyou were going to die,\nwho would you call,\nwhat would you say, what would you do?\nThat night is when 9/11 happened.\n\n\n\n18:29\n\n\nOne woman had come to the seminar,\nand when she came there,\nher previous boyfriend had been\nkidnapped and murdered.\nHer new boyfriend wanted to marry her,\nand she said no.\n\n\n\n18:37\n\n\nHe said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing,\nit's over with us.\"\nShe said, \"It's over.\"\nWhen I finished that night,\nshe called him and left a message\nat the top of the World Trade Center\nwhere he worked, saying,\n\"I love you, I want you to know\nI want to marry you.\nIt was stupid of me.\"\nShe was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.\nfor us, when he called her back,\nand said, \"Honey, I can't tell you\nwhat this means.\nI don't know how to tell you this,\nbut you gave me the greatest gift,\nbecause I'm going to die.\"\nAnd she played the recording\nfor us in the room.\nShe was on Larry King later.\nAnd he said, \"You're probably wondering\nhow on Earth this could\nhappen to you twice.\nAll I can say is this must be\nGod's message to you.\nFrom now on, every day,\ngive your all, love your all.\nDon't let anything ever stop you.\"\nShe finishes, and a man\nstands up, and he says,\n\"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.\nI'd love to hold your hand\nand say I'm sorry,\nbut frankly, this is retribution.\"\nI can't tell you the rest,\nbecause I'm out of time.\n\n\n\n19:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:38\n\n\nAre you sure?\n\n\n\n19:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:43\n\n\n10 seconds!\n\n\n\n19:45\n\n\n(Laughter and applause)\n\n\n\n19:48\n\n\n10 seconds, I want to be respectful.\nAll I can tell you is,\nI brought this man on stage\nwith a man from New York who worked\nin the World Trade Center,\nbecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.\nMore than 50 lost\ntheir entire companies, friends,\nmarking off their Palm Pilots.\nOne financial trader,\nwoman made of steel, bawling —\n30 friends crossing off that all died.\nAnd I said, \"What are we\ngoing to focus on?\nWhat does this mean\nand what are we going to do?\"\n\n\n\n20:12\n\n\nAnd I got the group to focus on:\nif you didn't lose somebody today,\nyour focus is going to be\nhow to serve somebody else.\nThen one woman stood up\nand was so angry, screaming and yelling.\nI found out she wasn't from New York,\nshe's not an American,\ndoesn't know anybody here.\nI asked, \"Do you always get angry?\"\nShe said, \"Yes.\"\nGuilty people got guilty,\nsad people got sad.\nI took these two men\nand I did an indirect negotiation.\nJewish man with family\nin the occupied territory,\nsomeone in New York who would have died\nif he was at work that day,\nand this man who wanted to be a terrorist,\nand I made it very clear.\nThis integration is on a film,\nwhich I'd be happy to send you,\ninstead of my verbalization,\nbut the two of them not only came together\nand changed their beliefs\nand models of the world,\nbut worked together to bring,\nfor almost four years now,\nthrough various mosques and synagogues,\nthe idea of how to create peace.\nAnd he wrote a book, called\n\"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\"\nSo, transformation can happen.\n\n\n\n21:03\n\n\nMy invitation to you is:\nexplore your web,\nthe web in here —\nthe needs, the beliefs, the emotions\nthat are controlling you,\nfor two reasons:\nso there's more of you to give,\nand achieve, too,\nbut I mean give,\nbecause that's what's\ngoing to fill you up.\nAnd secondly, so you can appreciate —\nnot just understand,\nthat's intellectual, that's the mind,\nbut appreciate\nwhat's driving other people.\nIt's the only way\nour world's going to change.\n\n\n\n21:27\n\n\nGod bless you, thank you.\nI hope this was of service.\n\n\n\n21:29\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI believe that the secret to producing\nextremely drought-tolerant crops,\nwhich should go some way\nto providing food security in the world,\nlies in resurrection plants,\npictured here, in an extremely\ndroughted state.\nYou might think\nthat these plants look dead,\nbut they're not.\nGive them water,\nand they will resurrect, green up,\nstart growing, in 12 to 48 hours.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nNow, why would I suggest\nthat producing drought-tolerant crops\nwill go towards providing food security?\nWell, the current world population\nis around 7 billion.\nAnd it's estimated that by 2050,\nwe'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,\nwith the bulk of this growth\nhappening in Africa.\n\n\n\n 0:56\n\n\nThe food and agricultural\norganizations of the world\nhave suggested that we need\na 70 percent increase\nin current agricultural practice\nto meet that demand.\nGiven that plants\nare at the base of the food chain,\nmost of that's going\nto have to come from plants.\n\n\n\n 1:12\n\n\nThat percentage of 70 percent\ndoes not take into consideration\nthe potential effects of climate change.\n\n\n\n 1:19\n\n\nThis is taken from a study by Dai\npublished in 2011,\nwhere he took into consideration\nall the potential effects\nof climate change\nand expressed them —\namongst other things —\nincreased aridity due to lack of rain\nor infrequent rain.\nThe areas in red shown here,\nare areas that until recently\nhave been very successfully\nused for agriculture,\nbut cannot anymore\nbecause of lack of rainfall.\nThis is the situation\nthat's predicted to happen in 2050.\nMuch of Africa,\nin fact, much of the world,\nis going to be in trouble.\nWe're going to have to think of some\nvery smart ways of producing food.\nAnd preferably among them,\nsome drought-tolerant crops.\n\n\n\n 2:00\n\n\nThe other thing\nto remember about Africa is\nthat most of their agriculture is rainfed.\n\n\n\n 2:07\n\n\nNow, making drought-tolerant crops\nis not the easiest thing in the world.\nAnd the reason for this is water.\nWater is essential to life on this planet.\nAll living, actively\nmetabolizing organisms,\nfrom microbes to you and I,\nare comprised predominately of water.\nAll life reactions happen in water.\nAnd loss of a small amount\nof water results in death.\nYou and I are 65 percent water —\nwe lose one percent of that, we die.\nBut we can make behavioral\nchanges to avoid that.\nPlants can't.\nThey're stuck in the ground.\nAnd so in the first instance they have\na little bit more water than us,\nabout 95 percent water,\nand they can lose\na little bit more than us,\nlike 10 to about 70 percent,\ndepending on the species,\nbut for short periods only.\n\n\n\n 2:55\n\n\nMost of them will either try\nto resist or avoid water loss.\nSo extreme examples of resistors\ncan be found in succulents.\nThey tend to be small, very attractive,\nbut they hold onto their water\nat such great cost\nthat they grow extremely slowly.\nExamples of avoidance of water loss\nare found in trees and shrubs.\nThey send down very deep roots,\nmine subterranean water supplies\nand just keep flushing\nit through them at all times,\nkeeping themselves hydrated.\n\n\n\n 3:24\n\n\nThe one on the right is called a baobab.\nIt's also called the upside-down tree,\nsimply because the proportion\nof roots to shoots is so great\nthat it looks like the tree\nhas been planted upside down.\nAnd of course the roots are required\nfor hydration of that plant.\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\nAnd probably the most common strategy\nof avoidance is found in annuals.\nAnnuals make up the bulk\nof our plant food supplies.\nUp the west coast of my country,\nfor much of the year\nyou don't see much vegetation growth.\nBut come the spring rains, you get this:\nflowering of the desert.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nThe strategy in annuals,\nis to grow only in the rainy season.\nAt the end of that season\nthey produce a seed,\nwhich is dry, eight to 10 percent water,\nbut very much alive.\nAnd anything that is\nthat dry and still alive,\nwe call desiccation-tolerant.\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nIn the desiccated state,\nwhat seeds can do\nis lie in extremes of environment\nfor prolonged periods of time.\nThe next time the rainy season comes,\nthey germinate and grow,\nand the whole cycle just starts again.\n\n\n\n 4:27\n\n\nIt's widely believed that the evolution\nof desiccation-tolerant seeds\nallowed the colonization and the radiation\nof flowering plants,\nor angiosperms, onto land.\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nBut back to annuals\nas our major form of food supplies.\nWheat, rice and maize form 95 percent\nof our plant food supplies.\nAnd it's been a great strategy\nbecause in a short space of time\nyou can produce a lot of seed.\nSeeds are energy-rich\nso there's a lot of food calories,\nyou can store it in times of plenty\nfor times of famine,\nbut there's a downside.\nThe vegetative tissues,\nthe roots and leaves of annuals,\ndo not have much\nby way of inherent resistance,\navoidance or tolerance characteristics.\nThey just don't need them.\nThey grow in the rainy season\nand they've got a seed\nto help them survive the rest of the year.\n\n\n\n 5:16\n\n\nAnd so despite concerted\nefforts in agriculture\nto make crops with improved properties\nof resistance, avoidance and tolerance —\nparticularly resistance and avoidance\nbecause we've had good models\nto understand how those work —\nwe still get images like this.\nMaize crop in Africa,\ntwo weeks without rain\nand it's dead.\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\nThere is a solution:\nresurrection plants.\nThese plants can lose 95 percent\nof their cellular water,\nremain in a dry, dead-like state\nfor months to years,\nand give them water,\nthey green up and start growing again.\nLike seeds, these are\ndesiccation-tolerant.\nLike seeds, these can withstand extremes\nof environmental conditions.\nAnd this is a really rare phenomenon.\nThere are only 135 flowering\nplant species that can do this.\n\n\n\n 6:07\n\n\nI'm going to show you a video\nof the resurrection process\nof these three species\nin that order.\nAnd at the bottom,\nthere's a time axis\nso you can see how quickly it happens.\n\n\n\n 6:55\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 7:01\n\n\nPretty amazing, huh?\n\n\n\n 7:02\n\n\nSo I've spent the last 21 years\ntrying to understand how they do this.\nHow do these plants dry without dying?\nAnd I work on a variety\nof different resurrection plants,\nshown here in the hydrated and dry states,\nfor a number of reasons.\n\n\n\n 7:16\n\n\nOne of them is that each\nof these plants serves as a model\nfor a crop that I'd like\nto make drought-tolerant.\n\n\n\n 7:22\n\n\nSo on the extreme top left,\nfor example, is a grass,\nit's called Eragrostis nindensis,\nit's got a close relative\ncalled Eragrostis tef —\na lot of you might know it as \"teff\" —\nit's a staple food in Ethiopia,\nit's gluten-free,\nand it's something we would like\nto make drought-tolerant.\n\n\n\n 7:37\n\n\nThe other reason for looking\nat a number of plants,\nis that, at least initially,\nI wanted to find out:\ndo they do the same thing?\nDo they all use the same mechanisms\nto be able to lose\nall that water and not die?\n\n\n\n 7:48\n\n\nSo I undertook what we call\na systems biology approach\nin order to get\na comprehensive understanding\nof desiccation tolerance,\nin which we look at everything\nfrom the molecular to the whole plant,\necophysiological level.\n\n\n\n 7:59\n\n\nFor example we look at things like\nchanges in the plant anatomy\nas they dried out\nand their ultrastructure.\nWe look at the transcriptome,\nwhich is just a term for a technology\nin which we look at the genes\nthat are switched on or off,\nin response to drying.\nMost genes will code for proteins,\nso we look at the proteome.\nWhat are the proteins made\nin response to drying?\nSome proteins would code for enzymes\nwhich make metabolites,\nso we look at the metabolome.\n\n\n\n 8:24\n\n\nNow, this is important\nbecause plants are stuck in the ground.\nThey use what I call\na highly tuned chemical arsenal\nto protect themselves from all\nthe stresses of their environment.\nSo it's important that we look\nat the chemical changes\ninvolved in drying.\n\n\n\n 8:39\n\n\nAnd at the last study\nthat we do at the molecular level,\nwe look at the lipidome —\nthe lipid changes in response to drying.\nAnd that's also important\nbecause all biological membranes\nare made of lipids.\nThey're held as membranes\nbecause they're in water.\nTake away the water,\nthose membranes fall apart.\nLipids also act as signals\nto turn on genes.\n\n\n\n 8:59\n\n\nThen we use physiological\nand biochemical studies\nto try and understand\nthe function of the putative protectants\nthat we've actually discovered\nin our other studies.\nAnd then use all of that\nto try and understand\nhow the plant copes\nwith its natural environment.\n\n\n\n 9:14\n\n\nI've always had the philosophy that\nI needed a comprehensive understanding\nof the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance\nin order to make a meaningful suggestion\nfor a biotic application.\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\nI'm sure some of you are thinking,\n\"By biotic application,\ndoes she mean she's going to make\ngenetically modified crops?\"\nAnd the answer to that question is:\ndepends on your definition\nof genetic modification.\n\n\n\n 9:38\n\n\nAll of the crops that we eat today,\nwheat, rice and maize,\nare highly genetically modified\nfrom their ancestors,\nbut we don't consider them GM\nbecause they're being produced\nby conventional breeding.\nIf you mean, am I going to put\nresurrection plant genes into crops,\nyour answer is yes.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nIn the essence of time,\nwe have tried that approach.\nMore appropriately,\nsome of my collaborators at UCT,\nJennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,\nhave spearheaded that approach\nand I'm going to show you some data soon.\n\n\n\n10:08\n\n\nBut we're about to embark\nupon an extremely ambitious approach,\nin which we aim to turn on\nwhole suites of genes\nthat are already present in every crop.\nThey're just never turned on\nunder extreme drought conditions.\nI leave it up to you to decide\nwhether those should be called GM or not.\n\n\n\n10:26\n\n\nI'm going to now just give you\nsome of the data from that first approach.\nAnd in order to do that\nI have to explain a little bit\nabout how genes work.\n\n\n\n10:34\n\n\nSo you probably all know\nthat genes are made\nof double-stranded DNA.\nIt's wound very tightly into chromosomes\nthat are present in every cell\nof your body or in a plant's body.\nIf you unwind that DNA, you get genes.\nAnd each gene has a promoter,\nwhich is just an on-off switch,\nthe gene coding region,\nand then a terminator,\nwhich indicates that this is the end\nof this gene, the next gene will start.\n\n\n\n10:58\n\n\nNow, promoters are not\nsimple on-off switches.\nThey normally require\na lot of fine-tuning,\nlots of things to be present and correct\nbefore that gene is switched on.\nSo what's typically done\nin biotech studies\nis that we use an inducible promoter,\nwe know how to switch it on.\nWe couple that to genes of interest\nand put that into a plant\nand see how the plant responds.\n\n\n\n11:21\n\n\nIn the study that I'm going\nto talk to you about,\nmy collaborators used\na drought-induced promoter,\nwhich we discovered\nin a resurrection plant.\nThe nice thing about this promoter\nis that we do nothing.\nThe plant itself senses drought.\nAnd we've used it to drive antioxidant\ngenes from resurrection plants.\nWhy antioxidant genes?\nWell, all stresses,\nparticularly drought stress,\nresults in the formation of free radicals,\nor reactive oxygen species,\nwhich are highly damaging\nand can cause crop death.\nWhat antioxidants do is stop that damage.\n\n\n\n11:56\n\n\nSo here's some data from a maize strain\nthat's very popularly used in Africa.\nTo the left of the arrow\nare plants without the genes,\nto the right —\nplants with the antioxidant genes.\nAfter three weeks without watering,\nthe ones with the genes\ndo a hell of a lot better.\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\nNow to the final approach.\nMy research has shown\nthat there's considerable similarity\nin the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance\nin seeds and resurrection plants.\nSo I ask the question,\nare they using the same genes?\nOr slightly differently phrased,\nare resurrection plants using genes\nevolved in seed desiccation tolerance\nin their roots and leaves?\nHave they retasked these seed genes\nin roots and leaves\nof resurrection plants?\n\n\n\n12:38\n\n\nAnd I answer that question,\nas a consequence of a lot\nof research from my group\nand recent collaborations from a group\nof Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,\nMel Oliver in the United States\nand Julia Buitink in France.\nThe answer is yes,\nthat there is a core set of genes\nthat are involved in both.\n\n\n\n12:55\n\n\nAnd I'm going to illustrate this\nvery crudely for maize,\nwhere the chromosomes below the off switch\nrepresent all the genes that are required\nfor desiccation tolerance.\nSo as maize seeds dried out\nat the end of their period of development,\nthey switch these genes on.\nResurrection plants\nswitch on the same genes\nwhen they dry out.\nAll modern crops, therefore,\nhave these genes\nin their roots and leaves,\nthey just never switch them on.\nThey only switch them on in seed tissues.\n\n\n\n13:24\n\n\nSo what we're trying to do right now\nis to understand the environmental\nand cellular signals\nthat switch on these genes\nin resurrection plants,\nto mimic the process in crops.\n\n\n\n13:34\n\n\nAnd just a final thought.\nWhat we're trying to do very rapidly\nis to repeat what nature did\nin the evolution of resurrection plants\nsome 10 to 40 million years ago.\n\n\n\n13:45\n\n\nMy plants and I thank you\nfor your attention.\n\n\n\n13:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWe all have milestones in life\nthat we remember so vividly.\nThe first one for me\nwas when I was entering kindergarten.\nMy big brother was in school,\nand by golly, it was my time.\nAnd I went trottin' down that hallway.\nI was so excited, I almost wet myself.\nAnd I go to the door,\nand there was the teacher\nwith a warm welcome,\nand she took me into the classroom,\nshowed me my little cubbyhole —\nwe all remember those\nlittle cubbyholes, don't we —\nand we put our stuff in there.\nAnd then she said, \"Go over to the circle\nand play with the kids\nuntil class starts.\"\nSo I went over there\nand plopped down like I owned the place,\nand I'm playing,\nand all of a sudden, the boy next to me,\nhe was wearing a white shirt\nwith blue shorts.\nI remember it like it was yesterday.\nSuddenly he stopped playing and he said,\n\"Why are you so short?\"\nAnd I just kept playing.\nI didn't think he was talking to me.\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:08\n\n\nAnd in a louder voice, he said,\n\"Hey, why are you so short?\"\nSo I looked up and I said,\n\"What are you talking about?\nLet's just play. We're happy.\nI've been waiting for this.\"\n\n\n\n 1:20\n\n\nAnd so we played,\nand about a minute later,\nthe girl next to him,\nin a white shirt and a pink skirt,\nstood up, put her hands on her hips,\nand said, \"Yeah,\nwhy do you look so different?\"\nAnd I went, \"What are you talking about?\nI don't look different. I'm not short.\nAgain, let's just play.\"\n\n\n\n 1:39\n\n\nAbout this time, I looked\nall around the circle I was in,\nand all the kids had stopped playing\nand they were all looking at me.\nAnd I'm thinking —\nin today's language,\nit would be \"OMG\" or \"WTF.\"\n\n\n\n 1:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:56\n\n\nWhat just happened?\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nSo all the confidence\nthat I went in with that morning\nwas withering away as the morning went on\nand the questions kept coming.\nAnd at the end of the morning,\nbefore I went home,\nthe teacher had us in a circle,\nand I actually found myself\noutside of the circle.\nI couldn't look at anybody.\nI could not understand what just happened.\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\nAnd over the next few years,\nI hated to go out in public.\nI felt every stare, every giggle,\nevery pointed finger,\nnot the finger,\nbut every pointed finger,\nand I hated it.\nI would hide behind my parents' legs\nlike nobody could see me.\nAnd as a child,\nyou can't understand\nanother child's curiosity,\nnor an adult's ignorance.\nIt became very apparent to me\nthat the real world was not built\nfor someone of my size,\nboth literally or figuratively.\n\n\n\n 2:55\n\n\nAnd so I have no anonymity,\nas you can probably tell,\nand while you can see my size,\nwe all go through many challenges\nthrough our lifetime.\nAnd some you can see, like mine.\nMost you can't.\nYou can't tell if someone's dealing\nwith a mental illness,\nor they're struggling\nwith their gender identity,\nthey're caring for an aging parent,\nthey're having financial difficulty.\nYou can't see that kind of stuff.\nSo while you can see\none of my challenges is my size,\nseeing does not mean you understand\nwhat it's truly to be me on a daily basis,\nor what I go through.\nAnd so I'm here to debunk a myth.\nI do not believe you can\nwalk in someone else's shoes,\nand because of that, we must adopt\na new way of giving of ourselves.\nSimply stated, I will never know\nwhat it's like to be you\nand you will never know\nwhat it's like to be me.\nI cannot face your fears\nor chase your dreams,\nand you can't do that for me,\nbut we can be supportive of each other.\nInstead of trying to walk\nin each other's shoes,\nwe must adopt a new way\nof giving of ourselves.\n\n\n\n 4:10\n\n\nI learned at an early age\nthat I did have to do some things\ndifferent than most people,\nbut I also learned there were things\nI was on equal footing with,\nand one of those was the classroom.\nHeh, heh, heh. I was equal.\nAs a matter of fact,\nI excelled in the classroom.\nThis was vitally important,\nI discovered as I grew older\nand realized I wasn't going to be able\nto do a physical job.\nI needed an education.\nSo I went on and got a university degree,\nbut I felt to be one step ahead\nof everyone for employment,\nI needed to have\nan advanced university degree,\nso I went ahead and got that.\n\n\n\n 4:48\n\n\nNow I'm ready for my interview.\nRemember your first interview?\nWhat am I going to wear?\nWhat questions?\nAnd don't forget that firm handshake.\nI was right there with you.\nSo 24 hours before my interview,\na friend of mine\nwho I've known all my life\ncalled and said, \"Michele,\nthe building you're going in has steps.\"\nAnd she knew I couldn't climb steps.\nSo suddenly, my focus changed.\nIn my shoes, I was worried\nabout how am I going to get there?\nSo I went early and found a loading dock\nand got in and had a great interview.\nThey had no idea what I went through\nfor the day and that's OK.\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nYou're probably thinking my greatest\nchallenge that day was the interview,\nor getting in the building.\nIn reality, my biggest challenge that day\nwas getting through the loading dock\nwithout getting run over.\nI am very vulnerable\nin certain situations:\nairports, hallways, parking lots,\nloading docks.\nAnd so I have to be very careful.\nI have to anticipate and be flexible\nand move as quickly as I can sometimes.\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nSo I got the job,\nand in my current role\nI travel quite a bit.\nAnd travel is a challenge\nfor all of us these days.\nAnd so you probably get to the airport,\nrun through security, get to the gate.\nDid I get my aisle seat or my window seat?\nDid I get my upgrade?\nMe, first of all,\nI don't run through anything.\n\n\n\n 6:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\nAnd I especially don't run through the TSA\nbecause I get to experience\nthe personal patdown.\nI won't comment on that.\nAnd then I make my way to the gate,\nand with my gift of gab\nthat my parents said I was born with,\nI talk to the gate agent, and then I say,\n\"By the way, my scooter weighs this much,\nI have a dry cell battery,\nand I can drive it down\nto the door of the plane.\"\nAlso, the day before, I had called\nthe city where I'm traveling to\nto find out where I could rent a scooter\nin case mine gets broken on the way.\nSo in my shoes,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n\n\n 6:51\n\n\nWhen I get onto the plane,\nI use my gift of gab to ask the lady\nto put my bag up, and they graciously do.\nI try not to eat or drink on a plane\nbecause I don't want to have to\nget up and walk on the plane,\nbut nature has its own schedule,\nand not long ago,\nit knocked and I answered.\nSo I walked up to the front of the plane\nand gabbed with the flight attendant,\nand said, \"Can you watch the door?\nI can't reach the lock.\"\nSo I'm in there doing my business,\nand the door flies open.\nAnd there's a gentleman there\nwith a look of horror on his face.\nI'm sure I had the same look.\nAs I came out, I noticed\nthat he was sitting right across from me,\nand he's in total, complete embarrassment.\nSo I walk up to him and I quietly go,\n\"Are you going to remember this\nas much as I am?\"\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nAnd he goes, \"I think so.\"\n\n\n\n 7:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:50\n\n\nNow, while he's probably\nnot talking about it publicly, I am.\n\n\n\n 7:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:55\n\n\nBut we talked for the rest of the flight,\nand we got to know each other,\nour families, sports, work,\nand when we landed, he said,\n\"Michele, I noticed\nsomeone put your bag up.\nCan I get that for you?\"\nAnd I said, \"Of course, thank you.\"\nAnd we wished each other well,\nand the most important thing that day\nwas that he was not going to leave\nwith that embarrassment,\nthat experience of embarrassment.\nHe won't forget it, and neither will I,\nbut I think he will remember more\nour chat and our different perspectives.\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\nWhen you travel internationally,\nit can be even more challenging\nin certain ways.\nA few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,\nand I come wheeling in,\nand think about that.\nShort, white, blond woman in a chair.\nThat doesn't probably happen every day.\nSo I go up, and with my gift of gab,\nI start to talk to the agent.\nSo friendly, and I ask\nabout their culture and so forth,\nand I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.\nSo I had to kind of say,\n\"Not only do you have to lift my chair,\nI could use some help\ngetting up the steps.\"\nSo we got to spend about an hour together\nwhile we waited for the flight,\nand it was the most magnificent hour.\nOur perspective changed\nfor both of us that day.\nAnd once I got on the flight,\nhe patted me on the back\nand wished me well,\nand I thanked him so much.\nAnd again, I think he's going\nto remember that experience more\nthan when I first came in,\nand there was a bit of hesitation.\n\n\n\n 9:30\n\n\nAnd as you notice, I get a lot of help.\nI would not be where I am today\nif it was not for my family,\nmy friends, my colleagues\nand the many strangers\nthat help me every single day of my life.\nAnd it's important\nthat we all have a support system.\nAsking for help is a strength,\nnot a weakness.\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:59\n\n\nWe all need help throughout our lifetime,\nbut it is just as important\nthat we are part\nof other people's support systems.\nWe must adopt that way of giving back.\nWe all obviously have a role to play\nin our own successes,\nbut think about the role we have to play\nin other people's successes,\njust like people do for me\nevery single day.\n\n\n\n10:25\n\n\nIt's vitally important\nthat we help each other,\nbecause society is increasingly\nplacing people in silos\nbased on biases and ideologies.\nAnd we must look past the surface\nand be confronted with the truth\nthat none of us are what you can see.\nThere's more to us than that,\nand we're all dealing with things\nthat you cannot see.\nSo living a life free of judgment\nallows all of us to share\nthose experiences together\nand have a totally different perspective,\njust like the couple of people\nI mentioned earlier in my stories.\n\n\n\n11:10\n\n\nSo remember, the only shoes\nyou truly can walk in are your own.\nI cannot walk in yours.\nI know you can't walk in my size 1s —\n\n\n\n11:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:22\n\n\nbut you can try.\nBut we can do something better than that.\nWith compassion,\ncourage and understanding,\nwe can walk side by side\nand support one another,\nand think about how society can change\nif we all do that\ninstead of judging\non only what you can see.\n\n\n\n11:44\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:46\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:51\n\n\nThank you.\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nGood afternoon, I'm proud\nto be here at TEDxKrakow.\nI'll try to speak a little bit today\nabout a phenomenon\nwhich can, and actually is\nchanging the world,\nand whose name is people power.\nI'll start with an anecdote,\nor for those of you\nwho are Monty Python lovers,\na Monty Python type of sketch.\nHere it is.\n\n\n\n 0:30\n\n\nIt is December 15, 2010.\nSomebody gives you a bet:\nyou will look at a crystal ball,\nand you will see the future;\nthe future will be accurate.\nBut you need to share it with the world.\nOK, curiosity killed the cat,\nyou take the bet,\nyou look at the crystal ball.\nOne hour later, you're sitting\nin a building of the national TV,\nin a top show, and you tell the story.\nBefore the end of 2011,\nBen Ali, and Mubarak,\nand Gaddafi would be down,\nand prosecuted.\nSaleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria\nwould be either challenged,\nor already on their knees.\nOsama bin Laden would be dead,\nand Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague.\n\n\n\n 1:12\n\n\nNow, the anchor watches you\nwith a strange gaze on his face.\nAnd then, on top of it you add:\n\"And thousands of young people\nfrom Athens, Madrid and New York\nwill demonstrate for social justice,\nclaiming they are inspired by Arabs.\"\n\n\n\n 1:27\n\n\nNext thing you know,\ntwo guys in white appear,\nthey give you the strange t-shirt,\ntake you to the nearest\nmental institution.\nSo I would like to speak a little bit\nabout the phenomenon which is behind\nwhat already seems to be\na very bad year for bad guys.\nAnd this phenomenon\nis called people power.\n\n\n\n 1:45\n\n\nWell, people power\nhas been there for a while.\nIt helped Gandhi kick\nthe Brits from India,\nit helped Martin Luther King\nwin his historic racial struggle.\nIt helped a local, Lech Walesa,\nto kick out one million\nSoviet troops from Poland,\nand in beginning the end\nof the Soviet Union as we know it.\n\n\n\n 2:04\n\n\nSo what's new in it?\nWhat seems to be very new,\nwhich is the idea I would like\nto share with you today,\nis that there is a set of rules and skills\nwhich can be learned and taught\nin order to perform\nsuccessful nonviolent struggle.\nIf this is true, we can help\nthese movements.\n\n\n\n 2:22\n\n\nWell, the first one - analytic skills.\nI'll try where it all started\nin the Middle East.\nAnd for so many years,\nwe were living with a completely wrong\nperception of the Middle East.\nIt was looking like the frozen region.\nLiterally a refrigerator.\nAnd there were only\ntwo types of meal there.\nSteak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali\ntype of military police dictatorship,\nor a potato, which stands for\na Tehran type of theocracies.\nAnd everybody was amazed\nwhen the refrigerator opened,\nand millions of young,\nmainly secular people\nstepped out to do the change.\nGuess what - they didn't watch\nthe demographics.\nWhat is the average age\nof an Egyptian? 24.\nHow long was Mubarak in power? 31.\nSo, this system was just\nobsolete, they expired.\nAnd young people of the Arab world\nhave awakened one morning,\nand understood that power\nlies in their hands.\nThe rest is the year in front of us.\nAnd guess what? The same Generation Y,\nwith their rules, with their tools,\nwith their games,\nand with their language,\nwhich sounds a little bit strange to me.\nI'm 38 now.\nAnd can you look at the age\nof the people on the streets of Europe?\nIt seems that Generation Y is coming.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nNow, let me set another example.\nI'm meeting different people\nthroughout the world,\nand they are, you know, academics,\nand professors, and doctors,\nand they will always talk conditions.\nThey will say: \"People power will work\nonly if the regime is not too oppressive.\"\nThey will say: \"People power will work,\nif the annual income of the country\nis between X and Z.\"\nThey will say: \"People power will work\nonly if there is a foreign pressure.\"\nThey will say: \"People power\nwill work only if there is no oil.\"\nAnd, I mean, there is a set of conditions.\nWell, the news here\nis that your skills during the conflict\nseem to be more important\nthan the conditions.\nNamely, the skills of unity, planning,\nand maintaining nonviolent discipline.\n\n\n\n 4:19\n\n\nLet me give you an example.\nI come from a country called Serbia.\nIt took us 10 years to unite\n18 opposition party leaders,\nwith their big egos,\nbehind one single candidate\nagainst the Balkan dictator\nSlobodan Milosevic.\nGuess what? That was\nthe day of his defeat.\nYou look at the Egyptians,\nthey fight on Tahrir Square,\nthey get rid of their individual symbols,\nthey appear on the street\nonly with the flag of Egypt.\nI will give you a counter-example.\nYou see nine presidential candidates\nrunning against Lukashenko,\nyou all know the outcome.\nSo unity is a big thing.\nAnd this can be achieved.\nSame with planning.\nSomebody has lied to you\nabout the successful and spontaneous\nnonviolent revolution.\nThat thing doesn't exist in the world.\nWhenever you see young people\nin front of the row\ntrying to fraternize\nwith the police or military,\nsomebody was thinking about it before.\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\nNow, at the end, nonviolent discipline.\nAnd this is probably the game-changer.\nIf you maintain nonviolent discipline,\nyou'll exclusively win.\nYou have 100,000 people\nin a nonviolent march,\none idiot or agent-provocateur\nthrowing a stone.\nGuess what takes all the cameras.\nThat one guy.\nOne single act of violence\ncan literally destroy your movement.\n\n\n\n 5:32\n\n\nNow, let me move to another place.\nIt's the selection\nof strategies and tactics.\nThere are certain rules\nin nonviolent struggle you may follow.\nFirst, you start small.\nSecond, you pick the battles you can win.\nIt's only 200 of us in this room.\nWe won't call for the march of a million.\nBut what if we organized the spraying\nof graffiti throughout the night,\nall over Krakow.\nThe city will know.\nSo, we pick tactics\naccommodated to the event,\nespecially this thing we call\nthe small tactics of dispersion.\nThey're very useful in violent oppression.\nWe are actually witnessing the picture\nof one of the best tactics ever used.\nIt was on Tahrir square,\nwhere the international community\nwas constantly frightened\nthat, you know, the Islamists\nwill overtake the revolution.\nWhat they organized —\nChristians protecting Muslims\nwhere they are praying,\na Coptic wedding cheered\nby thousands of Muslims,\nthe world has just changed the picture,\nbut somebody was thinking\nabout this previously.\nSo there are so many things you can do\ninstead of getting into one place,\nshouting, and you know, showing off\nin front of the security forces.\n\n\n\n 6:42\n\n\nNow, there is also another\nvery important dynamic.\nAnd this is a dynamic\nthat analysts normally don't see.\nThis is the dynamic between\nfear and apathy on the one side,\nand enthusiasm and humor on another side.\nSo, it works like in a video game.\nYou have the fear high,\nyou have status quo.\nYou have the enthusiasm higher,\nyou see the fear is starting to melt.\nDay two, you see people\nrunning towards the police\ninstead of from the police, in Egypt.\nYou can tell that something\nis happening there.\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nAnd then, it's about the humor.\nHumor is such a powerful game-changer,\nand of course, it was very big in Poland.\nYou know, we were just a small group\nof crazy students in Serbia\nwhen we made this big skit.\nWe put the big petrol barrel\nwith a portrait of Mr. President on it,\nin the middle of the Main Street.\nThere was a hole in the top.\nSo you could literally come,\nput a coin in,\nget a baseball bat, and hit his face.\nSounds loud.\nAnd within minutes,\nwe were sitting in a nearby café\nhaving coffee,\nand there was a queue of people\nwaiting to do this lovely thing.\nWell, that's just\nthe beginning of the show.\nThe real show starts\nwhen the police appears.\n\n\n\n 7:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:53\n\n\n\"What will they do?\"\nArrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.\nWe were like three blocks away,\nobserving it from our espresso bar.\nArrest the shoppers, with kids?\nDoesn't make sense.\nOf course, you could bet,\nthey did the most stupid thing.\nThey arrested the barrel.\nAnd now, the picture\nof the smashed face on the barrel,\nwith the policemen\ndragging it to the police car,\nthat was the best day\nfor newspaper photographers\nthat they will ever have.\n\n\n\n 8:17\n\n\nSo, I mean, these are\nthe things you can do.\nAnd you can always use humor.\nThere is also one big thing about humor,\nit really hurts.\nBecause these guys really are\ntaking themselves too seriously.\nWhen you start to mock them, it hurts.\n\n\n\n 8:32\n\n\nNow, everybody is talking\nabout His Majesty, the Internet,\nand it is also a very useful skill.\nBut don't rush to label things\nlike \"a Facebook Revolution,\"\n\"Twitter Revolution.\"\nDon't mix the tools\nwith the substance.\nIt is true that the Internet\nand the new media are very useful\nin making things faster and cheaper.\nThey also make it a bit safer\nfor the participants,\nbecause they give partial anonymity.\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\nWe're watching the great example\nof something else the Internet can do.\nIt can put the price tag\nof state-sponsored violence\nover a nonviolent protester.\nThis is the famous group\n\"We are all Khaled Said,\"\nmade by Wael Ghonim\nin Egypt, and his friend.\nThis is the mutilated face of the guy\nwho was beaten by the police.\nThis is how he became known to the public,\nand this is what probably became\nthe straw that broke the camel's back.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nBut here is also the bad news.\nThe nonviolent struggle is won\nin the real world, in the streets.\nYou will never change\nyour society towards democracy,\nor, you know, the economy,\nif you sit down and click.\nThere are risks to be taken,\nand there are living people\nwho are winning the struggle.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nWell, the million-dollar question.\nWhat will happen in the Arab world?\nAnd though young people\nfrom the Arab world\nwere pretty successful\nin bringing down three dictators,\nshaking the region,\nkind of persuading the clever kings\nfrom Jordan and Morocco\nto do substantial reforms,\nit is yet to be seen\nwhat will be the outcome.\nWhether the Egyptians and Tunisians\nwill make it through the transition,\nor this will end in bloody\nethnic and religious conflicts,\nwhether the Syrians\nwill maintain nonviolent discipline,\nfaced with a brutal daily violence\nwhich kills thousands already,\nor they will slip into violent struggle\nand make ugly civil war.\nWill these revolutions be pushed\nthrough the transitions and democracy\nor be overtaken by the military\nor extremists of all kinds?\nWe cannot tell.\nThe same works for the Western sector,\nwhere you can see\nall these excited young people\nprotesting around the world,\noccupying this, occupying that.\nAre they going to become the world wave?\nAre they going to find their skills,\ntheir enthusiasm, and their strategy\nto find what they really want\nand push for the reform,\nor will they just stay complaining\nabout the endless list\nof the things they hate?\nThis is the difference\nbetween the two paths.\n\n\n\n11:03\n\n\nNow, what do the statistics have?\nMy friend Maria Stephan's book\ntalks a lot about violent\nand nonviolent struggle,\nand there are some shocking data.\nIf you look at the last 35 years\nand different social transitions,\nfrom dictatorship to democracy,\nyou will see that,\nout of 67 different cases,\nin 50 of these cases\nit was nonviolent struggle\nwhich was the key power.\nThis is one more reason\nto look at this phenomenon,\nthis is one more reason\nto look at Generation Y.\nEnough for me to give them credit,\nand hope that they will find their skills\nand their courage\nto use nonviolent struggle\nand thus fix at least a part of the mess\nour generation is making in this world.\n\n\n\n11:50\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIt's easy to forget that last night,\none billion people went to sleep\nwithout access to electricity.\nOne billion people.\nTwo and a half billion people\ndid not have access to clean cooking fuels\nor clean heating fuels.\nThose are the problems\nin the developing world.\nAnd it's easy for us not to be empathetic\nwith those people\nwho seem so distanced from us.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nBut even in our own world,\nthe developed world,\nwe see the tension of stagnant economies\nimpacting the lives of people around us.\nWe see it in whole pieces of the economy,\nwhere the people involved\nhave lost hope about the future\nand despair about the present.\nWe see that in the Brexit vote.\nWe see that in the Sanders/Trump\ncampaigns in my own country.\nBut even in countries as recently\nturning the corner\ntowards being in the developed world,\nin China,\nwe see the difficulty\nthat President Xi has\nas he begins to un-employ so many people\nin his coal and mining industries\nwho see no future for themselves.\nAs we as a society\nfigure out how to manage\nthe problems of the developed world\nand the problems of the developing world,\nwe have to look at how we move forward\nand manage the environmental impact\nof those decisions.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nWe've been working on this problem\nfor 25 years, since Rio,\nthe Kyoto Protocols.\nOur most recent move is the Paris treaty,\nand the resulting climate agreements\nthat are being ratified\nby nations around the world.\nI think we can be very hopeful\nthat those agreements,\nwhich are bottom-up agreements,\nwhere nations have said\nwhat they think they can do,\nare genuine and forthcoming\nfor the vast majority of the parties.\nThe unfortunate thing\nis that now, as we look\nat the independent analyses\nof what those climate treaties\nare liable to yield,\nthe magnitude of the problem\nbefore us becomes clear.\n\n\n\n 2:17\n\n\nThis is the United States\nEnergy Information Agency's assessment\nof what will happen if the countries\nimplement the climate commitments\nthat they've made in Paris\nbetween now and 2040.\nIt shows basically CO2 emissions\naround the world\nover the next 30 years.\nThere are three things that you need\nto look at and appreciate.\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nOne, CO2 emissions are expected\nto continue to grow\nfor the next 30 years.\nIn order to control climate,\nCO2 emissions have to literally go to zero\nbecause it's the cumulative emissions\nthat drive heating on the planet.\nThis should tell you that we are losing\nthe race to fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n 3:06\n\n\nThe second thing you should notice\nis that the bulk of the growth\ncomes from the developing countries,\nfrom China, from India,\nfrom the rest of the world,\nwhich includes South Africa\nand Indonesia and Brazil,\nas most of these countries\nmove their people\ninto the lower range of lifestyles\nthat we literally take for granted\nin the developed world.\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\nThe final thing that you should notice\nis that each year,\nabout 10 gigatons of carbon are getting\nadded to the planet's atmosphere,\nand then diffusing into the ocean\nand into the land.\nThat's on top of the 550 gigatons\nthat are in place today.\nAt the end of 30 years,\nwe will have put 850 gigatons\nof carbon into the air,\nand that probably goes a long way\ntowards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase\nin global mean surface temperatures,\nlocking in ocean acidification\nand locking in sea level rise.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\nNow, this is a projection made by men\nby the actions of society,\nand it's ours to change, not to accept.\nBut the magnitude of the problem\nis something we need to appreciate.\n\n\n\n 4:29\n\n\nDifferent nations make\ndifferent energy choices.\nIt's a function\nof their natural resources.\nIt's a function of their climate.\nIt's a function of the development path\nthat they've followed as a society.\nIt's a function of where\non the surface of the planet they are.\nAre they where it's dark\na lot of the time,\nor are they at the mid-latitudes?\nMany, many, many things\ngo into the choices of countries,\nand they each make a different choice.\n\n\n\n 4:57\n\n\nThe overwhelming thing\nthat we need to appreciate\nis the choice that China has made.\nChina has made the choice,\nand will make the choice, to run on coal.\nThe United States has an alternative.\nIt can run on natural gas\nas a result of the inventions\nof fracking and shale gas,\nwhich we have here.\nThey provide an alternative.\nThe OECD Europe has a choice.\nIt has renewables that it can afford\nto deploy in Germany\nbecause it's rich enough\nto afford to do it.\nThe French and the British\nshow interest in nuclear power.\nEastern Europe, still very heavily\ncommitted to natural gas and to coal,\nand with natural gas\nthat comes from Russia,\nwith all of its entanglements.\nChina has many fewer choices\nand a much harder row to hoe.\n\n\n\n 5:52\n\n\nIf you look at China, and you ask yourself\nwhy has coal been important to it,\nyou have to remember what China's done.\nChina brought people to power,\nnot power to people.\nIt didn't do rural electrification.\nIt urbanized.\nIt urbanized by taking low-cost labor\nand low-cost energy,\ncreating export industries\nthat could fund a tremendous\namount of growth.\n\n\n\n 6:18\n\n\nIf we look at China's path,\nall of us know that prosperity in China\nhas dramatically increased.\nIn 1980, 80 percent of China's population\nlived below the extreme poverty level,\nbelow the level of having\n$1.90 per person per day.\nBy the year 2000, only 20 percent\nof China's population\nlived below the extreme poverty level —\na remarkable feat,\nadmittedly, with some costs\nin civil liberties\nthat would be tough to accept\nin the Western world.\nBut the impact of all that wealth\nallowed people to get\nmassively better nutrition.\nIt allowed water pipes to be placed.\nIt allowed sewage pipes to be placed,\ndramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,\nat the cost of some outdoor air pollution.\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\nBut in 1980, and even today,\nthe number one killer in China\nis indoor air pollution,\nbecause people do not have access\nto clean cooking and heating fuels.\nIn fact, in 2040,\nit's still estimated\nthat 200 million people in China\nwill not have access\nto clean cooking fuels.\nThey have a remarkable path to follow.\n\n\n\n 7:43\n\n\nIndia also needs to meet the needs\nof its own people,\nand it's going to do that by burning coal.\nWhen we look at the EIA's projections\nof coal burning in India,\nIndia will supply nearly four times\nas much of its energy from coal\nas it will from renewables.\nIt's not because they don't know\nthe alternatives;\nit's because rich countries\ncan do what they choose,\npoor countries do what they must.\n\n\n\n 8:17\n\n\nSo what can we do to stop\ncoal's emissions in time?\nWhat can we do that changes\nthis forecast that's in front of us?\nBecause it's a forecast that we can change\nif we have the will to do it.\n\n\n\n 8:32\n\n\nFirst of all, we have to think\nabout the magnitude of the problem.\nBetween now and 2040,\n800 to 1,600 new coal plants\nare going to be built around the world.\nThis week, between one and three\none-gigawatt coal plants\nare being turned on around the world.\nThat's happening regardless\nof what we want,\nbecause the people\nthat rule their countries,\nassessing the interests of their citizens,\nhave decided it's in the interest\nof their citizens to do that.\nAnd that's going to happen\nunless they have a better alternative.\nAnd every 100 of those plants will use up\nbetween one percent and three percent\nof the Earth's climate budget.\n\n\n\n 9:20\n\n\nSo every day that you go home\nthinking that you should do something\nabout global warming,\nat the end of that week, remember:\nsomebody fired up a coal plant\nthat's going to run for 50 years\nand take away your ability to change it.\n\n\n\n 9:36\n\n\nWhat we've forgotten is something\nthat Vinod Khosla used to talk about,\na man of Indian ethnicity\nbut an American venture capitalist.\nAnd he said, back in the early 2000s,\nthat if you needed to get\nChina and India off of fossil fuels,\nyou had to create a technology\nthat passed the \"Chindia test,\"\n\"Chindia\" being the appending\nof the two words.\nIt had to be first of all viable,\nmeaning that technically, they could\nimplement it in their country,\nand that it would be accepted\nby the people in the country.\n\n\n\n10:09\n\n\nTwo, it had to be a technology\nthat was scalable,\nthat it could deliver the same benefits\non the same timetable as fossil fuels,\nso that they can enjoy the kind of life,\nagain, that we take for granted.\n\n\n\n10:26\n\n\nAnd third, it had to be cost-effective\nwithout subsidy or without mandate.\nIt had to stand on its own two feet;\nit could not be maintained\nfor that many people\nif in fact, those countries\nhad to go begging\nor had some foreign country say,\n\"I won't trade with you,\"\nin order to get\nthe technology shift to occur.\n\n\n\n10:51\n\n\nIf you look at the Chindia test,\nwe simply have not come up\nwith alternatives that meet that test.\nThat's what the EIA forecast tells us.\nChina's building 800 gigawatts of coal,\n400 gigawatts of hydro,\nabout 200 gigawatts of nuclear,\nand on an energy-equivalent basis,\nadjusting for intermittency,\nabout 100 gigawatts of renewables.\n800 gigawatts of coal.\nThey're doing that, knowing the costs\nbetter than any other country,\nknowing the need better\nthan any other country.\nBut that's what they're aiming for in 2040\nunless we give them a better choice.\nTo give them a better choice,\nit's going to have to meet\nthe Chindia test.\n\n\n\n11:37\n\n\nIf you look at all the alternatives\nthat are out there,\nthere are really two\nthat come near to meeting it.\nFirst is this area of new nuclear\nthat I'll talk about in just a second.\nIt's a new generation of nuclear plants\nthat are on the drawing boards\naround the world,\nand the people who are\ndeveloping these say\nwe can get them\nin position to demo by 2025\nand to scale by 2030,\nif you will just let us.\nThe second alternative\nthat could be there in time\nis utility-scale solar\nbacked up with natural gas,\nwhich we can use today,\nversus the batteries\nwhich are still under development.\n\n\n\n12:15\n\n\nSo what's holding new nuclear back?\nOutdated regulations\nand yesterday's mindsets.\nWe have not used our latest\nscientific thinking on radiological health\nto think how we communicate\nwith the public\nand govern the testing\nof new nuclear reactors.\nWe have new scientific knowledge\nthat we need to use\nin order to improve the way\nwe regulate nuclear industry.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\nThe second thing is we've got a mindset\nthat it takes 25 years\nand 2 to 5 billion dollars\nto develop a nuclear power plant.\nThat comes from the historical,\nmilitary mindset\nof the places nuclear power came from.\nThese new nuclear ventures are saying\nthat they can deliver power\nfor 5 cents a kilowatt hour;\nthey can deliver it\nfor 100 gigawatts a year;\nthey can demo it by 2025;\nand they can deliver it in scale by 2030,\nif only we give them a chance.\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nRight now, we're basically\nwaiting for a miracle.\nWhat we need is a choice.\nIf they can't make it safe,\nif they can't make it cheap,\nit should not be deployed.\nBut what I want you to do\nis not carry an idea forward,\nbut write your leaders,\nwrite the head of the NGOs you support,\nand tell them to give you the choice,\nnot the past.\n\n\n\n13:38\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\n[This talk contains graphic content.\nViewer discretion is advised.]\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\nThis is Nina Rodríguez's Facebook profile.\nThis person had three different profiles\nand 890 kids between 8 and 13 years old\namong her friends list.\nThese are excerpts of a chat\nwith one of those kids.\nThis is an exact copy of the chat.\nIt's part of the case file.\nThis kid started sending private photos\nuntil his family realized\nwhat was going on.\nThe police report and subsequent\ninvestigation lead them to a house.\nThis was the girl's bedroom.\nNina Rodríguez was actually\na 24-year-old man\nthat used to do this with lots of kids.\n\n\n\n 1:12\n\n\nMicaela Ortega was 12 years old\nwhen she went to meet\nher new Facebook friend,\nalso 12.\n\"Rochi de River,\" was her name.\nShe actually met Jonathan Luna,\nwho was 26 years old.\nWhen they finally caught him,\nhe confessed that he killed the girl\nbecause she refused to have sex with him.\nHe had four Facebook profiles\nand 1,700 women on his contact list;\n90 percent of them\nwere under 13 years old.\n\n\n\n 1:51\n\n\nThese are two different\ncases of \"grooming\":\nan adult contacts a kid\nthrough the internet,\nand through manipulation or lying,\nleads that kid into sexual territory —\nfrom talking about sex\nto sharing private photos,\nrecording the kid using a webcam\nor arranging an in-person meeting.\nThis is grooming.\nThis is happening, and it's on the rise.\nThe question is: What are we going to do?\nBecause, in the meantime, kids are alone.\nThey finish dinner, go to their rooms,\nclose the door,\nget on their computer, their cell phones,\nand get into a bar,\ninto a club.\n\n\n\n 2:41\n\n\nThink for one second\nabout what I've just said:\nthey're in a place full of strangers\nin an uninhibited environment.\nThe internet broke physical boundaries.\nWhen we're alone in our bedroom\nand we go online,\nwe're not really alone.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nThere are at least two reasons\nwhy we're not taking care of this,\nor at least not in the right way.\nFirst, we're sure that everything\nthat happens online is \"virtual.\"\nIn fact, we call it \"the virtual world.\"\nIf you look it up in the dictionary,\nsomething virtual is something\nthat seems to exist\nbut is not real.\nAnd we use that word\nto talk about the internet:\nsomething not real.\nAnd that's the problem with grooming.\nIt is real.\nDegenerate, perverted adults\nuse the internet to abuse boys and girls\nand take advantage of, among other things,\nthe fact that the kids and their parents\nthink that what happens online\ndoesn't actually happen.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nSeveral years ago,\nsome colleagues and I founded an NGO\ncalled \"Argentina Cibersegura,\"\ndedicated to raising awareness\nabout online safety.\nIn 2013, we attended meetings\nat the House of Legislature\nto discuss a law about grooming.\nI remember that a lot of people thought\nthat grooming was strictly a precursor\nto arranging an in-person meeting\nwith a kid to have sex with them.\nBut they didn't think about what happened\nto the kids who were exposed\nby talking about sex\nwith an adult without knowing it,\nor who shared intimate photos thinking\nonly another kid would see them,\nor even worse,\nwho had exposed themselves\nusing their web cam.\nNobody considered that rape.\nI'm sure lots of you find it odd to think\none person can abuse another\nwithout physical contact.\nWe're programmed to think that way.\nI know, because I used to think that way.\nI was just an IT security guy\nuntil this happened to me.\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\nAt the end of 2011,\nin a little town in Buenos Aires Province,\nI heard about a case for the first time.\nAfter giving a talk,\nI met the parents of an 11-year-old girl\nwho had been a victim of grooming.\nA man had manipulated her\ninto masturbating in front of her web cam,\nand recorded it.\nAnd the video was on several websites.\nThat day, her parents asked us, in tears,\nto tell them the magic formula\nfor how to delete those videos\nfrom the internet.\nIt broke my heart and changed me forever\nto be their last disappointment,\ntelling them it was too late:\nonce content is online,\nwe've already lost control.\n\n\n\n 6:03\n\n\nSince that day, I think about that girl\nwaking up in the morning,\nhaving breakfast with her family,\nwho had seen the video,\nand then walking to school, meeting\npeople that had seen her naked,\narriving to school, playing with\nher friends, who had also seen her.\nThat was her life.\nExposed.\nOf course, nobody raped her body.\nBut hadn't her sexuality been abused?\n\n\n\n 6:41\n\n\nWe clearly use different standards\nto measure physical and digital things.\nAnd we get angry at social networks\nbecause being angry with ourselves\nis more painful and more true.\nAnd this brings us\nto the second reason why\nwe aren't paying proper\nattention to this issue.\nWe're convinced that kids\ndon't need our help,\nthat they \"know everything\"\nabout technology.\n\n\n\n 7:11\n\n\nWhen I was a kid,\nat one point, my parents started\nletting me walk to school alone.\nAfter years of taking me by the hand\nand walking me to school,\none day they sat me down,\ngave me the house keys\nand said, \"Be very careful with these;\ndon't give them to anyone,\ntake the route we showed you,\nbe at home at the time we said,\ncross at the corner,\nand look both ways before you cross,\nand no matter what,\ndon't talk to strangers.\"\nI knew everything about walking,\nand yet, there was a responsible adult\nthere taking care of me.\nKnowing how to do something is one thing,\nknowing how to take care\nof yourself is another.\nImagine this situation:\nI'm 10 or 11 years old,\nI wake up in the morning,\nmy parents toss me the keys and say,\n\"Seba, now you can walk to school alone.\"\nAnd when I come back late,\nthey say, \"No, you need to be home\nat the time we said.\"\nAnd two weeks later,\nwhen it comes up,\nthey say, \"You know what?\nYou have to cross at the corner,\nand look both ways before crossing.\"\nAnd two years later, they say,\n\"And also, don't talk to strangers.\"\nIt sounds absurd, right?\n\n\n\n 8:37\n\n\nWe have the same absurd behavior\nin relation to technology.\nWe give kids total access\nand we see if one day, sooner or later,\nthey learn how to take care of themselves.\nKnowing how to do something is one thing,\nknowing how to take care\nof yourself is another.\n\n\n\n 8:55\n\n\nAlong those same lines,\nwhen we talk to parents,\nthey often say they don't care\nabout technology and social networks.\nI always rejoin that by asking\nif they care about their kids.\nAs adults, being interested\nor not in technology\nis the same as being interested\nor not in our kids.\nThe internet is part of their lives.\nTechnology forces us to rethink\nthe relationship between adults and kids.\nEducation was always based\non two main concepts:\nexperience and knowledge.\nHow do we teach our kids to be safe online\nwhen we don't have either?\n\n\n\n 9:39\n\n\nNowadays, we adults\nhave to guide our children\nthrough what is often for us\nunfamiliar territory —\nterritory much more inviting for them.\nIt's impossible to find an answer\nwithout doing new things —\nthings that make us uncomfortable,\nthings we're not used to.\n\n\n\n 9:58\n\n\nA lot of you may think it's easy for me,\nbecause I'm relatively young.\nAnd it used to be that way.\nUsed to.\nUntil last year,\nwhen I felt the weight\nof my age on my shoulders\nthe first time I opened Snapchat.\n\n\n\n10:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:25\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:30\n\n\nI didn't understand a thing!\nI found it unnecessary,\nuseless, hard to understand;\nit looked like a camera!\nIt didn't have menu options!\nIt was the first time I felt the gap\nthat sometimes exists\nbetween kids and adults.\nBut it was also an opportunity\nto do the right thing,\nto leave my comfort zone, to force myself.\nI never thought I'd ever use Snapchat,\nbut then I asked my teenage cousin\nto show me how to use it.\nI also asked why she used it.\nWhat was fun about it?\nWe had a really nice talk.\nShe showed me her Snapchat,\nshe told me things,\nwe got closer, we laughed.\nToday, I use it.\n\n\n\n11:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nI don't know if I do it right,\nbut the most important thing\nis that I know it and I understand it.\nThe key was to overcome the initial shock\nand do something new.\nSomething new.\nToday, we have the chance\nto create new conversations.\nWhat's the last app you downloaded?\nWhich social network do you use\nto contact your friends?\nWhat kind of information do you share?\nHave you ever been\napproached by strangers?\nCould we have these conversations\nbetween kids and adults?\nWe have to force ourselves\nto do it. All of us.\nToday, lots of kids are listening to us.\nSometimes when we go\nto schools to give our talks,\nor through social networks,\nkids ask or tell us things\nthey haven't told\ntheir parents or their teachers.\nThey tell us — they don't even know us.\nThose kids need to know\nwhat the risks of being online are,\nhow to take care of themselves,\nbut also that, fundamentally,\nas with almost everything else,\nkids can learn this from any adult.\n\n\n\n12:50\n\n\nOnline safety needs to be\na conversation topic\nin every house and every\nclassroom in the country.\nWe did a survey this year that showed\nthat 15 percent of schools said\nthey knew of cases of grooming\nin their school.\nAnd this number is growing.\nTechnology changed\nevery aspect of our life,\nincluding the risks we face\nand how we take care of ourselves.\n\n\n\n13:19\n\n\nGrooming shows us this\nin the most painful way:\nby involving our kids.\nAre we going to do something\nto avoid this?\nThe solution starts\nwith something as easy as:\ntalking about it.\n\n\n\n13:36\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:37\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI've always had a fascination\nfor computers and technology,\nand I made a few apps for the iPhone,\niPod touch, and iPad.\nI'd like to share a couple with you today.\nMy first app was a unique\nfortune teller called \"Earth Fortune\"\nthat would display\ndifferent colors of Earth\ndepending on what your fortune was.\nMy favorite and most successful app\nis \"Bustin Jieber,\" which is —\n\n\n\n 0:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\nwhich is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:42\n\n\nI created it because\na lot of people at school\ndisliked Justin Bieber a little bit,\nso I decided to make the app.\nSo I went to work programming it,\nand I released it\njust before the holidays in 2010.\nA lot of people ask me,\nhow did I make these?\nA lot of times it's because\nthe person who asked the question\nwants to make an app also.\nA lot of kids these days\nlike to play games,\nbut now they want to make them,\nand it's difficult,\nbecause not many kids know where to go\nto find out how to make a program.\nI mean, for soccer,\nyou could go to a soccer team.\nFor violin, you could get\nlessons for a violin.\nBut what if you want to make an app?\nAnd the kid's parents might have done\nsome of these things when they were young,\nbut not many parents have written apps.\n\n\n\n 1:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:33\n\n\nWhere do you go to find out\nhow to make an app?\nWell, this is how I approached it,\nthis is what I did.\nFirst of all, I've been programming\nin multiple other programming languages\nto get the basics down,\nsuch as Python, C, Java, etc.\nAnd then Apple released the iPhone,\nand with it, the iPhone\nsoftware development kit,\nand the software development kit\nis a suite of tools\nfor creating and programming\nan iPhone app.\nThis opened up a whole new world\nof possibilities for me,\nand after playing with the software\ndevelopment kit a little bit,\nI made a couple of apps,\nI made some test apps.\nOne of them happened to be\n\"Earth Fortune,\"\nand I was ready to put\n\"Earth Fortune\" on the App Store,\nand so I persuaded my parents\nto pay the 99 dollar fee\nto be able to put my apps\non the App Store.\nThey agreed, and now I have\napps on the App Store.\nI've gotten a lot of interest\nand encouragement\nfrom my family, friends, teachers\nand even people at the Apple Store,\nand that's been a huge help to me.\n\n\n\n 2:40\n\n\nI've gotten a lot\nof inspiration from Steve Jobs,\nand I've started an app club at school,\nand a teacher at my school\nis kindly sponsoring my app club.\nAny student at my school can come\nand learn how to design an app.\nThis is so I can share\nmy experiences with others.\nThere's these programs\ncalled the iPad Pilot Program,\nand some districts have them.\nI'm fortunate enough to be part of one.\nA big challenge is,\nhow should the iPads be used,\nand what apps should we put on the iPads?\nSo we're getting feedback\nfrom teachers at the school\nto see what kind of apps they'd like.\nWhen we design the app and we sell it,\nit will be free to local districts;\nand other districts that we sell to —\nall the money from that will go\ninto the local ed foundations.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nThese days, students usually know\na little bit more than teachers\nwith the technology.\n\n\n\n 3:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:49\n\n\nSo —\n\n\n\n 3:51\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:54\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\n\n 3:55\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nSo this is a resource to teachers,\nand educators should recognize\nthis resource and make good use of it.\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:07\n\n\nI'd like to finish up by saying\nwhat I'd like to do in the future.\nFirst of all, I'd like to create\nmore apps, more games.\nI'm working with a third party\ncompany to make an app.\nI'd like to get into Android\nprogramming and development,\nand I'd like to continue my app club,\nand find other ways for students\nto share knowledge with others.\n\n\n\n 4:29\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 4:30\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI want to talk to you about something\nkind of big.\nWe'll start here.\nSixty-five million years ago —\n\n\n\n 0:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:23\n\n\nthe dinosaurs had a bad day.\n\n\n\n 0:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:29\n\n\nA chunk of rock six miles across,\nmoving something like 50 times\nthe speed of a rifle bullet,\nslammed into the Earth.\nIt released its energy all at once,\nand it was an explosion\nthat was mind-numbing.\nIf you took every\nnuclear weapon ever built\nat the height of the Cold War,\nlumped them together,\nand blew them up at the same time,\nthat would be one one-millionth\nof the energy released at that moment.\nThe dinosaurs had a really bad day.\nOK?\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nNow, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.\nWe all live here in Boulder.\nIf you look out your window\nand see Longs Peak —\nyou're probably familiar with it —\nnow, scoop up Longs Peak\nand put it out in space.\nTake ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.\nLump that in there,\nand put that in space as well.\nAnd Mt. Everest. And K2.\nAnd the Indian peaks.\nThen you're starting to get an idea\nof how much rock we're talking about, OK?\nWe know it was that big\nbecause of the impact it had\nand the crater it left.\nIt hit in what we now know\nas Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.\nYou can see here,\nthere's the Yucatan Peninsula,\nif you recognize Cozumel\noff the east coast there.\nHere is how big of a crater was left.\nIt was huge.\n\n\n\n 1:44\n\n\nTo give you a sense\nof the scale ... there you go.\nThe scale here is 50 miles on top,\na hundred kilometers on the bottom.\nThis thing was 300 kilometers\nacross — 200 miles —\nan enormous crater that excavated\nout vast amounts of earth\nthat splashed around the globe\nand set fires all over the planet,\nthrew up enough dust to block out the sun.\nIt wiped out 75 percent\nof all species on Earth.\nNow, not all asteroids are that big.\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\nSome of them are smaller.\nHere is one that came in\nover the United States in October of 1992.\nIt came in on a Friday night.\nWhy is that important?\nBecause back then, video cameras\nwere just starting to become popular,\nand parents would bring them\nto their kids' football games\nto film their kids playing football.\nAnd since this came in on a Friday,\nthey were able to get this great footage\nof this thing breaking up\nas it came in over West Virginia,\nMaryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey\nuntil it did that\nto a car in New York.\n\n\n\n 2:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nNow, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,\nbut then again, you can see the rock,\nwhich is sitting right here,\nabout the size of a football,\nthat hit that car and did that damage.\nNow, this thing was probably\nabout the size of a school bus\nwhen it first came in.\nIt broke up through atmospheric pressure,\nit crumbled, and then\nthe pieces fell apart\nand did some damage.\nNow, you wouldn't want that falling\non your foot or your head,\nbecause it would do that to it.\nThat would be bad.\nBut it won't wipe out, you know,\nall life on Earth, so that's fine.\n\n\n\n 3:18\n\n\nBut it turns out, you don't need\nsomething six miles across\nto do a lot of damage.\nThere is a median point\nbetween tiny rock and gigantic rock,\nand in fact, if any of you\nhave ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,\nthere is a crater in the desert\nthere that is so iconic\nthat it is actually\ncalled \"Meteor Crater.\"\nTo give you a sense of scale,\nthis is about a mile wide.\nIf you look up at the top,\nthat's a parking lot,\nand those are recreational\nvehicles right there.\nSo it's about a mile across,\n600 feet deep.\nThe object that formed this\nwas probably about 30 to 50 yards across,\nso roughly the size\nof Macky Auditorium here.\nIt came in at speeds that were tremendous,\nslammed into the ground, blew up,\nand exploded with the energy of roughly\na 20-megaton nuclear bomb —\na very hefty bomb.\nThis was 50,000 years ago,\nso it may have wiped out\na few buffalo or antelope,\nor something like that out in the desert,\nbut it probably would not have caused\nglobal devastation.\n\n\n\n 4:20\n\n\nIt turns out that these things\ndon't have to hit the ground\nto do a lot of damage.\nNow, in 1908, over Siberia,\nnear the Tunguska region —\nfor those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans\nand saw \"Ghostbusters,\"\nwhen he talked about the greatest\ncross-dimensional rift\nsince the Siberia blast of 1909,\nwhere he got the date\nwrong, but that's OK.\n\n\n\n 4:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:41\n\n\nIt was 1908. That's fine.\nI can live with that.\n\n\n\n 4:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\nAnother rock came\ninto the Earth's atmosphere\nand this one blew up above the ground,\nseveral miles up\nabove the surface of the Earth.\nThe heat from the explosion\nset fire to the forest below it,\nand then the shock wave came down\nand knocked down trees\nfor hundreds of square miles.\nThis did a huge amount of damage.\nAnd again, this was a rock\nprobably roughly the size\nof this auditorium that we're sitting in.\nIn Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,\nand metal is much tougher,\nso it made it to the ground.\nThe one over Tunguska\nwas probably made of rock,\nand that's much more crumbly,\nso it blew up in the air.\n\n\n\n 5:21\n\n\nEither way, these are tremendous\nexplosions — 20 megatons.\nNow, when these things blow up,\nthey're not going to do\nglobal ecological damage.\nThey're not going to do\nsomething like the dinosaur killer did.\nThey're just not big enough.\nBut they will do global economic damage,\nbecause they don't have\nto hit, necessarily,\nto do this kind of damage.\nThey don't have to do global devastation.\nIf one of these things were to hit\npretty much anywhere,\nit would cause a panic.\nBut if it came over a city,\nan important city —\nnot that any city\nis more important than others,\nbut some of them we depend on more\non the global economic basis —\nthat could do a huge amount of damage\nto us as a civilization.\nSo, now that I've scared\nthe crap out of you —\n\n\n\n 6:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:07\n\n\nwhat can we do about this?\nThis is a potential threat.\nLet me note that we have not had\na giant impact like the dinosaur killer\nfor 65 million years.\nThey're very rare.\nThe smaller ones happen more often,\nbut probably on the order of a millennium,\nevery few centuries\nor every few thousand years.\nBut it's still something to be aware of.\nWell, what do we do about them?\nThe first thing\nwe have to do is find them.\nThis is an image of an asteroid\nthat passed us in 2009.\nIt's right here.\nBut you can see that it's extremely faint.\nI don't know if you can see that\nin the back row.\nThese are just stars.\n\n\n\n 6:44\n\n\nThis is a rock\nthat was about 30 yards across,\nso roughly the size of the ones\nthat blew up over Tunguska\nand hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.\nThese things are faint.\nThey're hard to see,\nand the sky is really big.\nWe have to find these things first.\nWell, the good news is,\nwe're looking for them.\nNASA has devoted money to this;\nthe National Science Foundation\nand other countries\nare interested in doing this.\nWe're building telescopes\nthat are looking for the threat.\n\n\n\n 7:09\n\n\nThat's a great first step.\nBut what's the second step?\nThe second step is if we see one heading\ntoward us, we have to stop it.\nWhat do we do?\nYou've probably heard\nabout the asteroid Apophis.\nIf you haven't yet, you will.\nIf you've heard about the Mayan\n2012 apocalypse,\nyou're going to hear about Apophis,\nbecause you're keyed in\nto all the doomsday networks, anyway.\n\n\n\n 7:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:30\n\n\nApophis is an asteroid\nthat was discovered in 2004.\nIt's roughly 250 [meters] across,\nso it's pretty big —\nbigger than a football stadium.\nAnd it's going to pass\nby the Earth in April of 2029.\nAnd it's going to pass us so close\nthat it's actually going to come\nunderneath our weather satellites.\nThe Earth's gravity is going to bend\nthe orbit of this thing so much\nthat if it's just right,\nif it passes through this region of space,\nthis kidney-bean-shaped region\ncalled the keyhole,\nthe Earth's gravity will bend it\njust enough that seven years later,\non April 13 — which is a Friday,\nI'll note — in the year 2036 —\n\n\n\n 8:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:08\n\n\nyou can't plan that kind of stuff —\n\n\n\n 8:10\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nApophis is going to hit us.\nAnd it's 250 meters across,\nso it would do unbelievable damage.\nThe good news is that the odds of it\nactually passing through this keyhole\nand hitting us next go-around\nare one in a million, roughly —\nvery, very low odds.\nSo I personally am not lying awake\nat night worrying about this at all.\nI don't think Apophis is a problem.\nIn fact, Apophis\nis a blessing in disguise,\nbecause it woke us up\nto the dangers of these things.\nThis thing was discovered\njust a few years ago\nand could hit us a few years from now.\nIt won't, but it gives us a chance\nto study these kinds of asteroids.\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nWe didn't really necessarily understand\nthese keyholes, and now we do,\nand it turns out that's really important,\nbecause how do you stop\nan asteroid like this?\nWell, let me ask you:\nWhat happens if you're standing\nin the road and a car's headed for you?\nWhat do you do?\nYou do this. Right?\nMove, and the car goes past you.\nBut we can't move the Earth,\nat least not easily,\nbut we can move a small asteroid.\n\n\n\n 9:03\n\n\nAnd it turns out, we've even done it.\nIn the year 2005, NASA launched\na probe called Deep Impact,\nwhich slammed a piece of itself\ninto the nucleus of a comet.\nComets are very much like asteroids.\nThe purpose wasn't to push it\nout of the way;\nthe purpose was to make a crater\nto excavate the material\nand see what was underneath\nthe surface of this comet,\nwhich we learned quite a bit about.\nWe did move the comet a little tiny bit —\nnot very much, but that wasn't the point.\nHowever, think about this:\nThis thing is orbiting the Sun\nat 10, 20 miles per second.\nWe shot a space probe\nat it and hit it, OK?\nImagine how hard that must be,\nand we did it.\nThat means we can do it again.\nIf we see an asteroid that's coming\ntoward us, headed right for us,\nand we have two years to go?\nBoom! We hit it.\nYou know, if you watch the movies —\n\n\n\n 9:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:54\n\n\nyou might think:\nWhy don't we use a nuclear weapon?\nWell, you can try that,\nbut the problem is timing.\nShoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,\nyou have to blow it up\nwithin a few milliseconds of tolerance,\nor else you'll miss it.\nAnd there are a lot of other problems\nwith that; it's very hard to do.\nBut just hitting something?\nThat's pretty easy.\nI think even NASA can do that,\nand proved that they can.\n\n\n\n10:13\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\nThe problem is, if you hit this asteroid,\nyou've changed the orbit,\nyou measure the orbit,\nthen you find out, oh yeah,\nwe just pushed it into a keyhole,\nand now it's going to hit us\nin three years.\nWell, my opinion is: fine!\nIt's not hitting us in six months —\nthat's good.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nNow we have three years\nto do something else.\nAnd you can hit it again.\nThat's kind of ham-fisted;\nyou might just push it\ninto a third keyhole or whatever,\nso you don't do that.\nAnd this is the part —\nit's the part I just love.\n\n\n\n10:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:44\n\n\nAfter the big macho \"Grr ... bam!\nWe're gonna hit this thing in the face,\"\nthen we bring in the velvet gloves.\n\n\n\n10:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\nThere's a group of scientists\nand engineers and astronauts,\nand they call themselves\nThe B612 Foundation.\nFor those of you who've read\n\"The Little Prince,\"\nyou understand that reference, I hope —\nthe little prince lived\non an asteroid called B612.\nThese are smart guys — men and women —\nastronauts, like I said, engineers.\nRusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9\nastronaut, is on this.\nDan Durda, my friend who made this image,\nworks here at Southwest Research Institute\nin Boulder, on Walnut Street.\nHe created this image for this.\nHe's actually one of the astronomers\nwho works for them.\nIf we see an asteroid\nthat's going to hit the Earth\nand we have enough time,\nwe can hit it to move it\ninto a better orbit.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\n\nBut then what we do is launch a probe\nthat has to weigh a ton or two.\nIt doesn't have to be huge —\na couple of tons, not that big —\nand you park it near the asteroid.\nYou don't land on it, because these things\nare tumbling end over end.\nIt's very hard to land on them.\nInstead you get near it.\nThe gravity of the asteroid\npulls on the probe,\nand the probe\nhas a couple of tons of mass.\nIt has a little tiny bit of gravity,\nbut it's enough\nthat it can pull the asteroid,\nand you have your rocket set up —\nyou can barely see it here,\nbut there's rocket plumes —\nand these guys are connected\nby their own gravity,\nand if you move the probe\nvery slowly — very, very gently,\nyou can very easily finesse that rock\ninto a safe orbit.\nYou can even put in orbit\naround the Earth where we could mine it,\nalthough that's a whole other thing;\nI won't go into that.\n\n\n\n12:17\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:18\n\n\nBut we'd be rich!\n\n\n\n12:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:26\n\n\nSo think about this, right?\nThere are these giant rocks flying\nout there, and they're hitting us,\nand they're doing damage to us.\nBut we've figured out how to do this,\nand all the pieces\nare in place to do this.\nWe have astronomers\nwith telescopes, looking for them.\nWe have very, very smart people,\nwho are concerned about this\nand figuring out how to fix the problem,\nand we have the technology to do this.\nThis probe actually can't use\nchemical rockets.\nChemical rockets provide\ntoo much thrust, too much push.\nThe probe would just shoot away.\n\n\n\n12:54\n\n\nWe invented something called an ion drive,\nwhich is a very, very,\nvery low-thrust engine.\nIt generates the force a piece of paper\nwould have on your hand —\nincredibly light, but it can run\nfor months and years,\nproviding that very gentle push.\nIf anybody here is a fan\nof the original \"Star Trek,\"\nthey ran across an alien ship\nthat had an ion drive,\nand Spock said, \"They're very\ntechnically sophisticated.\nThey're a hundred years\nahead of us with this drive.\"\nYeah, we have an ion drive now.\nWe don't have the Enterprise,\nbut we've got an ion drive now.\n\n\n\n13:24\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:28\n\n\nSpock.\n\n\n\n13:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\nSo ...\nThat's the difference —\nthat's the difference\nbetween us and the dinosaurs.\nThis happened to them.\nIt doesn't have to happen to us.\nThe difference\nbetween the dinosaurs and us\nis that we have a space program\nand we can vote,\nand so we can change our future.\n\n\n\n13:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:54\n\n\nWe have the ability to change our future.\nSixty-five million years from now,\nwe don't have to have our bones\ncollecting dust in a museum.\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n14:03\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nOur grandparents' generation\ncreated an amazing system\nof canals and reservoirs\nthat made it possible\nfor people to live in places\nwhere there wasn't a lot of water.\nFor example, during the Great Depression,\nthey created the Hoover Dam,\nwhich in turn, created Lake Mead\nand made it possible for the cities\nof Las Vegas and Phoenix\nand Los Angeles to provide water\nfor people who lived\nin a really dry place.\n\n\n\n 0:36\n\n\nIn the 20th century,\nwe literally spent trillions of dollars\nbuilding infrastructure\nto get water to our cities.\nIn terms of economic development,\nit was a great investment.\nBut in the last decade,\nwe've seen the combined effects\nof climate change, population growth\nand competition for water resources\nthreaten these vital lifelines\nand water resources.\n\n\n\n 1:00\n\n\nThis figure shows you the change\nin the lake level of Lake Mead\nthat happened in the last 15 years.\nYou can see starting around the year 2000,\nthe lake level started to drop.\nAnd it was dropping at such a rate\nthat it would have left the drinking water\nintakes for Las Vegas high and dry.\nThe city became so concerned about this\nthat they recently constructed\na new drinking water intake structure\nthat they referred to as the \"Third Straw\"\nto pull water out\nof the greater depths of the lake.\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\nThe challenges associated\nwith providing water to a modern city\nare not restricted\nto the American Southwest.\nIn the year 2007, the third largest\ncity in Australia, Brisbane,\ncame within 6 months\nof running out of water.\nA similar drama is playing out today\nin São Paulo, Brazil,\nwhere the main reservoir for the city\nhas gone from being\ncompletely full in 2010,\nto being nearly empty today\nas the city approaches\nthe 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n 2:01\n\n\nFor those of us who are fortunate enough\nto live in one\nof the world's great cities,\nwe've never truly experienced\nthe effects of a catastrophic drought.\nWe like to complain\nabout the navy showers we have to take.\nWe like our neighbors to see\nour dirty cars and our brown lawns.\nBut we've never really faced\nthe prospect of turning on the tap\nand having nothing come out.\nAnd that's because when things\nhave gotten bad in the past,\nit's always been possible\nto expand a reservoir\nor dig a few more groundwater wells.\nWell, in a time when all\nof the water resources are spoken for,\nit's not going to be possible\nto rely on this tried and true way\nof providing ourselves with water.\n\n\n\n 2:42\n\n\nSome people think that we're going\nto solve the urban water problem\nby taking water from our rural neighbors.\nBut that's an approach that's fraught\nwith political, legal and social dangers.\nAnd even if we succeed in grabbing\nthe water from our rural neighbors,\nwe're just transferring\nthe problem to someone else\nand there's a good chance\nit will come back and bite us\nin the form of higher food prices\nand damage to the aquatic ecosystems\nthat already rely upon that water.\n\n\n\n 3:11\n\n\nI think that there's a better way\nto solve our urban water crisis\nand I think that's to open up\nfour new local sources of water\nthat I liken to faucets.\nIf we can make smart investments\nin these new sources of water\nin the coming years,\nwe can solve our urban water problem\nand decrease the likelihood\nthat we'll ever run across\nthe effects of a catastrophic drought.\n\n\n\n 3:35\n\n\nNow, if you told me 20 years ago\nthat a modern city could exist\nwithout a supply of imported water,\nI probably would have dismissed you\nas an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.\nBut my own experiences\nworking with some of the world's most\nwater-starved cities in the last decades\nhave shown me that we have\nthe technologies and the management skills\nto actually transition away\nfrom imported water,\nand that's what I want\nto tell you about tonight.\n\n\n\n 4:02\n\n\nThe first source of local water\nsupply that we need to develop\nto solve our urban water problem\nwill flow with the rainwater\nthat falls in our cities.\nOne of the great tragedies\nof urban development\nis that as our cities grew,\nwe started covering all the surfaces\nwith concrete and asphalt.\nAnd when we did that,\nwe had to build storm sewers\nto get the water\nthat fell on the cities out\nbefore it could cause flooding,\nand that's a waste\nof a vital water resource.\nLet me give you an example.\n\n\n\n 4:33\n\n\nThis figure here shows you\nthe volume of water\nthat could be collected\nin the city of San Jose\nif they could harvest the stormwater\nthat fell within the city limits.\nYou can see from the intersection\nof the blue line and the black dotted line\nthat if San Jose could just capture half\nof the water that fell within the city,\nthey'd have enough water\nto get them through an entire year.\n\n\n\n 4:55\n\n\nNow, I know what some of you\nare probably thinking.\n\"The answer to our problem\nis to start building great big tanks\nand attaching them\nto the downspouts of our roof gutters,\nrainwater harvesting.\"\nNow, that's an idea\nthat might work in some places.\nBut if you live in a place\nwhere it mainly rains in the winter time\nand most of the water demand\nis in the summertime,\nit's not a very cost-effective way\nto solve a water problem.\nAnd if you experience the effects\nof a multiyear drought,\nlike California's currently experiencing,\nyou just can't build a rainwater tank\nthat's big enough to solve your problem.\n\n\n\n 5:27\n\n\nI think there's a lot more practical way\nto harvest the stormwater and\nthe rainwater that falls in our cities,\nand that's to capture it\nand let it percolate into the ground.\nAfter all, many of our cities are sitting\non top of a natural water storage system\nthat can accommodate\nhuge volumes of water.\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\nFor example, historically,\nLos Angeles has obtained\nabout a third of its water supply\nfrom a massive aquifer\nthat underlies the San Fernando Valley.\nNow, when you look at the water\nthat comes off of your roof\nand runs off of your lawn\nand flows down the gutter,\nyou might say to yourself,\n\"Do I really want to drink that stuff?\"\nWell, the answer is\nyou don't want to drink it\nuntil it's been treated a little bit.\nAnd so the challenge that we face\nin urban water harvesting\nis to capture the water, clean the water\nand get it underground.\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\nAnd that's exactly\nwhat the city of Los Angeles is doing\nwith a new project that they're building\nin Burbank, California.\nThis figure here shows\nthe stormwater park that they're building\nby hooking a series of stormwater\ncollection systems, or storm sewers,\nand routing that water\ninto an abandoned gravel quarry.\nThe water that's captured in the quarry\nis slowly passed\nthrough a man-made wetland,\nand then it goes\ninto that ball field there\nand percolates into the ground,\nrecharging the drinking water\naquifer of the city.\n\n\n\n 6:48\n\n\nAnd in the process\nof passing through the wetland\nand percolating through the ground,\nthe water encounters microbes\nthat live on the surfaces of the plants\nand the surfaces of the soil,\nand that purifies the water.\nAnd if the water's\nstill not clean enough to drink\nafter it's been through\nthis natural treatment process,\nthe city can treat it again\nwhen they pump if back out\nof the groundwater aquifers\nbefore they deliver it to people to drink.\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nThe second tap that we need to open up\nto solve our urban water problem\nwill flow with the wastewater\nthat comes out\nof our sewage treatment plants.\nNow, many of you are probably familiar\nwith the concept of recycled water.\nYou've probably seen signs like this\nthat tell you that the shrubbery\nand the highway median\nand the local golf course\nis being watered with water\nthat used to be\nin a sewage treatment plant.\nWe've been doing this\nfor a couple of decades now.\nBut what we're learning\nfrom our experience\nis that this approach is much more\nexpensive that we expected it to be.\nBecause once we build\nthe first few water recycling systems\nclose to the sewage treatment plant,\nwe have to build longer\nand longer pipe networks\nto get that water to where it needs to go.\nAnd that becomes prohibitive\nin terms of cost.\n\n\n\n 8:00\n\n\nWhat we're finding is\nthat a much more cost-effective\nand practical way of recycling wastewater\nis to turn treated wastewater\ninto drinking water\nthrough a two-step process.\nIn the first step in this process\nwe pressurize the water\nand pass it through\na reverse osmosis membrane:\na thin, permeable plastic membrane\nthat allows water molecules\nto pass through\nbut traps and retains the salts,\nthe viruses and the organic chemicals\nthat might be present in the wastewater.\n\n\n\n 8:28\n\n\nIn the second step in the process,\nwe add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide\nand shine ultraviolet light on the water.\nThe ultraviolet light\ncleaves the hydrogen peroxide\ninto two parts that are called\nhydroxyl radicals,\nand these hydroxyl radicals\nare very potent forms of oxygen\nthat break down most organic chemicals.\n\n\n\n 8:49\n\n\nAfter the water's been\nthrough this two-stage process,\nit's safe to drink.\nI know,\nI've been studying recycled water\nusing every measurement technique\nknown to modern science\nfor the past 15 years.\nWe've detected some chemicals\nthat can make it through\nthe first step in the process,\nbut by the time we get to the second step,\nthe advanced oxidation process,\nwe rarely see any chemicals present.\nAnd that's in stark contrast\nto the taken-for-granted water supplies\nthat we regularly drink all the time.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nThere's another way we can recycle water.\nThis is an engineered treatment wetland\nthat we recently built\non the Santa Ana River\nin Southern California.\nThe treatment wetland receives water\nfrom a part of the Santa Ana River\nthat in the summertime consists\nalmost entirely of wastewater effluent\nfrom cities like Riverside\nand San Bernardino.\nThe water comes\ninto our treatment wetland,\nit's exposed to sunlight and algae\nand those break down\nthe organic chemicals,\nremove the nutrients\nand inactivate the waterborne pathogens.\nThe water gets put back\nin the Santa Ana River,\nit flows down to Anaheim,\ngets taken out at Anaheim\nand percolated into the ground,\nand becomes the drinking water\nof the city of Anaheim,\ncompleting the trip\nfrom the sewers of Riverside County\nto the drinking water supply\nof Orange County.\n\n\n\n10:09\n\n\nNow, you might think\nthat this idea of drinking wastewater\nis some sort of futuristic fantasy\nor not commonly done.\nWell, in California, we already recycle\nabout 40 billion gallons a year\nof wastewater through the two-stage\nadvanced treatment process\nI was telling you about.\nThat's enough water to be\nthe supply of about a million people\nif it were their sole water supply.\n\n\n\n10:31\n\n\nThe third tap that we need to open up\nwill not be a tap at all,\nit will be a kind of virtual tap,\nit will be the water conservation\nthat we manage to do.\nAnd the place where we need to think\nabout water conservation is outdoors\nbecause in California\nand other modern American cities,\nabout half of our water use\nhappens outdoors.\n\n\n\n10:50\n\n\nIn the current drought,\nwe've seen that it's possible\nto have our lawns survive\nand our plants survive\nwith about half as much water.\nSo there's no need\nto start painting concrete green\nand putting in Astroturf\nand buying cactuses.\nWe can have California-friendly\nlandscaping with soil moisture detectors\nand smart irrigation controllers\nand have beautiful\ngreen landscapes in our cities.\n\n\n\n11:14\n\n\nThe fourth and final water tap\nthat we need to open up\nto solve our urban water problem\nwill flow with desalinated seawater.\nNow, I know what you probably heard\npeople say about seawater desalination.\n\"It's a great thing to do if you have\nlots of oil, not a lot of water\nand you don't care about climate change.\"\nSeawater desalination is energy-intensive\nno matter how you slice it.\nBut that characterization\nof seawater desalination\nas being a nonstarter\nis hopelessly out of date.\nWe've made tremendous progress\nin seawater desalination\nin the past two decades.\n\n\n\n11:47\n\n\nThis picture shows you\nthe largest seawater desalination plant\nin the Western hemisphere\nthat's currently being built\nnorth of San Diego.\nCompared to the seawater\ndesalination plant\nthat was built in\nSanta Barbara 25 years ago,\nthis treatment plant\nwill use about half the energy\nto produce a gallon of water.\n\n\n\n12:06\n\n\nBut just because seawater desalination\nhas become less energy-intensive,\ndoesn't mean we should start building\ndesalination plants everywhere.\nAmong the different choices we have,\nit's probably the most energy-intensive\nand potentially environmentally damaging\nof the options to create\na local water supply.\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nSo there it is.\nWith these four sources of water,\nwe can move away\nfrom our reliance on imported water.\nThrough reform in the way we landscape\nour surfaces and our properties,\nwe can reduce outdoor water use\nby about 50 percent,\nthereby increasing \nthe water supply by 25 percent.\nWe can recycle the water\nthat makes it into the sewer,\nthereby increasing\nour water supply by 40 percent.\nAnd we can make up the difference\nthrough a combination\nof stormwater harvesting\nand seawater desalination.\n\n\n\n12:54\n\n\nSo, let's create a water supply\nthat will be able\nto withstand any of the challenges\nthat climate change throws at us\nin the coming years.\nLet's create a water supply\nthat uses local sources\nand leaves more water\nin the environment for fish and for food.\nLet's create a water system that's\nconsistent with out environmental values.\nAnd let's do it for our children\nand our grandchildren\nand let's tell them this is the system\nthat they have to\ntake care of in the future\nbecause it's our last chance\nto create a new kind of water system.\n\n\n\n13:30\n\n\nThank you very much for your attention.\n\n\n\n13:32\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWe lost a lot of time at school\nlearning spelling.\nKids are still losing a lot of time\nat school with spelling.\nThat's why I want to share\na question with you:\nDo we need new spelling rules?\nI believe that yes, we do.\nOr even better, I think we need\nto simplify the ones we already have.\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\nNeither the question nor the answer\nare new in the Spanish language.\nThey have been bouncing around\nfrom century to century\nsince 1492, when in the first grammar\nguide of the Spanish language,\nAntonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simple\nprinciple for our spelling:\n\"... thus, we have to write words\nas we pronounce them,\nand pronounce words as we write them.\"\nEach sound was to correspond\nto one letter,\neach letter was to represent\na single sound,\nand those which did not represent\nany sound should be removed.\nThis approach, the phonetic approach,\nwhich says we have to write\nwords as we pronounce them,\nboth is and isn't at the root of spelling\nas we practice it today.\nIt is, because the Spanish language,\nin contrast to English, French or others,\nalways strongly resisted\nwriting words too differently\nto how we pronounce them.\n\n\n\n 1:42\n\n\nBut the phonetic approach\nis also absent today,\nbecause when, in the 18th century,\nwe decided how we would standardize\nour writing,\nthere was another approach which guided\na good part of the decisions.\nIt was the etymological approach,\nthe one that says we have to write words\naccording to how they were written\nin their original language,\nin Latin, in Greek.\nThat's how we ended up with silent H's,\nwhich we write but don't pronounce.\nThat's how we have B's and V's that,\ncontrary to what many people believe,\nwere never differentiated\nin Spanish pronunciation.\nThat's how we wound up with G's,\nthat are sometimes aspirated,\nas in \"gente,\"\nand other times unaspirated, as in \"gato.\"\nThat's how we ended up\nwith C's, S's and Z's,\nthree letters that in some places\ncorrespond to one sound,\nand in others, to two,\nbut nowhere to three.\n\n\n\n 2:36\n\n\nI'm not here to tell you anything\nyou don't know from your own experience.\nWe all went to school,\nwe all invested big amounts\nof learning time,\nbig amounts of pliant,\nchildlike brain time\nin dictation,\nin the memorization of spelling rules\nfilled, nevertheless, with exceptions.\nWe were told in many ways,\nimplicitly and explicitly,\nthat in spelling, something fundamental\nto our upbringing was at stake.\nYet, I have the feeling\nthat teachers didn't ask themselves\nwhy it was so important.\nIn fact, they didn't ask themselves\na previous question:\nWhat is the purpose of spelling?\nWhat do we need spelling for?\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\nAnd the truth is, when someone\nasks themselves this question,\nthe answer is much simpler\nand less momentous\nthan we'd usually believe.\nWe use spelling to unify the way we write,\nso we can all write the same way,\nmaking it easier for us to understand\nwhen we read to each other.\nBut unlike in other aspects of language\nsuch as punctuation,\nin spelling, there's no\nindividual expression involved.\nIn punctuation, there is.\nWith punctuation, I can choose\nto change the meaning of a phrase.\nWith punctuation, I can impose\na particular rhythm to what I am writing,\nbut not with spelling.\nWhen it comes to spelling,\nit's either wrong or right,\naccording to whether it conforms\nor not to the current rules.\nBut then, wouldn't it be more sensible\nto simplify the current rules\nso it would be easier to teach, learn\nand use spelling correctly?\nWouldn't it be more sensible\nto simplify the current rules\nso that all the time we devote today\nto teaching spelling,\nwe could devote to other language issues\nwhose complexities do, in fact,\ndeserve the time and effort?\n\n\n\n 4:53\n\n\nWhat I propose is not to abolish spelling,\nand have everyone write however they want.\nLanguage is a tool of common usage,\nand so I believe it's fundamental\nthat we use it following common criteria.\nBut I also find it fundamental\nthat those common criteria\nbe as simple as possible,\nespecially because\nif we simplify our spelling,\nwe're not leveling it down;\nwhen spelling is simplified,\nthe quality of the language\ndoesn't suffer at all.\n\n\n\n 5:33\n\n\nI work every day with Spanish\nGolden Age literature,\nI read Garcilaso, Cervantes,\nGóngora, Quevedo,\nwho sometimes write \"hombre\" without H,\nsometimes write \"escribir\" with V,\nand it's absolutely clear to me\nthat the difference between those texts\nand ours is one of convention,\nor rather, a lack of convention\nduring their time.\nBut it's not a difference of quality.\nBut let me go back to the masters,\nbecause they're key characters\nin this story.\nEarlier, I mentioned this slightly\nthoughtless insistence\nwith which teachers pester and pester us\nover spelling.\nBut the truth is,\nthings being as they are,\nthis makes perfect sense.\nIn our society, spelling serves\nas an index of privilege,\nseparating the cultured from the brute,\nthe educated from the ignorant,\nindependent of the content\nthat's being written.\nOne can get or not get a job\nbecause of an H that one put or did not.\nOne can become\nan object of public ridicule\nbecause of a misplaced B.\nTherefore, in this context,\nof course, it makes sense to dedicate\nall this time to spelling.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nBut we shouldn't forget\nthat throughout the history\nof our language,\nit has always been teachers\nor people involved\nin the early learning of language\nwho promoted spelling reforms,\nwho realized that in our spelling\nthere was often an obstacle\nto the transmission of knowledge.\nIn our case, for example,\nSarmiento, together with Andrés Bello,\nspearheaded the biggest spelling reform\nto take place in the Spanish language:\nthe mid-19th century Chilean reform.\nThen, why not take over\nthe task of those teachers\nand start making progress in our spelling?\nHere, in this intimate group of 10,000,\nI'd like to bring to the table\nsome changes that I find reasonable\nto start discussing.\n\n\n\n 7:51\n\n\nLet's remove the silent H.\nIn places where we write an H\nbut pronounce nothing,\nlet's not write anything.\n\n\n\n 8:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:01\n\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine\nwhat sentimental attachment\ncan justify to someone\nall the hassle caused by the silent H.\nB and V, as we said before,\nwere never differentiated\nin the Spanish language —\n\n\n\n 8:14\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:15\n\n\nLet's choose one; it could be either.\nWe can discuss it, talk it over.\nEveryone will have their preferences\nand can make their arguments.\nLet's keep one, remove the other.\nG and J, let's separate their roles.\nG should keep the unaspirated sound,\nlike in \"gato,\" \"mago,\" and \"águila,\"\nand J should keep the aspirated sound,\nas in \"jarabe,\" \"jirafa,\"\n\"gente,\" \"argentino.\"\nThe case of C, S and Z is interesting,\nbecause it shows that the phonetic\napproach must be a guide,\nbut it can't be an absolute principle.\nIn some cases, the differences\nin pronunciation must be addressed.\nAs I said before, C, S and Z,\nin some places, correspond\nto one sound, in others to two.\nIf we go from three letters\nto two, we're all better off.\n\n\n\n 9:11\n\n\nTo some, these changes\nmay seem a bit drastic.\nThey're really not.\nThe Royal Spanish Academy,\nall of language academies,\nalso believes that spelling\nshould be progressively modified;\nthat language is linked to history,\ntradition and custom,\nbut that at the same time,\nit is a practical everyday tool\nand that sometimes this attachment\nto history, tradition and custom\nbecomes an obstacle for its current usage.\nIndeed, this explains the fact\nthat our language, much more than\nthe others we are geographically close to,\nhas been historically\nmodifying itself based on us,\nfor example, we went\nfrom \"ortographia\" to \"ortografía,\"\nfrom \"theatro\" to \"teatro,\"\nfrom \"quantidad\" to \"cantidad,\"\nfrom \"symbolo\" to \"símbolo.\"\nAnd some silent H's are slowly\nbeing stealthily removed:\nin the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,\n\"arpa\" and \"armonía\" can be written\nwith or without an H.\nAnd everybody is OK.\n\n\n\n10:26\n\n\nI also believe\nthat this is a particularly appropriate\nmoment to have this discussion.\nIt's always said that language\nchanges spontaneously,\nfrom the bottom up,\nthat its users are the ones\nwho incorporate new words\nand who introduce grammatical changes,\nand that the authority —\nin some places an academy,\nin others a dictionary,\nin others a ministry —\naccepts and incorporates them\nlong after the fact.\nThis is true only\nfor some levels of language.\nIt is true on the lexical level,\nthe level of words.\nIt is less true on the grammatical level,\nand I would almost say\nit is not true for the spelling level,\nthat has historically changed\nfrom the top down.\nInstitutions have always been the ones\nto establish the rules\nand propose changes.\n\n\n\n11:28\n\n\nWhy do I say this is a particularly\nappropriate moment?\nUntil today,\nwriting always had a much more restricted\nand private use than speech.\nBut in our time,\nthe age of social networks,\nthis is going through\na revolutionary change.\nNever before have people written so much;\nnever before have people written\nfor so many others to see.\nAnd in these social networks,\nfor the first time,\nwe're seeing innovative uses\nof spelling on a large scale,\nwhere even more-than-educated people\nwith impeccable spelling,\nwhen using social networks,\nbehave a lot like the majority of users\nof social networks behave.\nThat is to say, they slack\non spell-checking\nand prioritize speed and efficacy\nin communication.\nFor now, on social networks,\nwe see chaotic, individual usages.\nBut I think we have\nto pay attention to them,\nbecause they're probably telling us\nthat an era that designates\na new place for writing\nseeks new criteria for that writing.\nI think we'd be wrong\nto reject them, to discard them,\nbecause we identify them as symptoms\nof the cultural decay of our times.\nNo, I believe we have to observe them,\norganize them and channel them\nwithin guidelines that better correspond\nto the needs of our times.\n\n\n\n13:09\n\n\nI can anticipate some objections.\nThere will be those who'll say\nthat if we simplify spelling\nwe'll lose etymology.\nStrictly speaking, if we wanted\nto preserve etymology,\nit would go beyond just spelling.\nWe'd also have to learn\nLatin, Greek, Arabic.\nWith simplified spelling,\nwe would normalize etymology\nin the same place we do now:\nin etymological dictionaries.\nA second objection will come\nfrom those who say:\n\"If we simplify spelling,\nwe'll stop distinguishing\nbetween words that differ\nin just one letter.\"\nThat is true, but it's not a problem.\nOur language has homonyms,\nwords with more than one meaning,\nyet we don't confuse\nthe \"banco\" where we sit\nwith the \"banco\" where we deposit money,\nor the \"traje\" that we wear\nwith the things we \"trajimos.\"\nIn the vast majority of situations,\ncontext dispels any confusion.\n\n\n\n14:18\n\n\nBut there's a third objection.\nTo me,\nit's the most understandable,\neven the most moving.\nIt's the people who'll say:\n\"I don't want to change.\nI was brought up like this,\nI got used to doing it this way,\nwhen I read a written word\nin simplified spelling, my eyes hurt.\"\n\n\n\n14:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:45\n\n\nThis objection is, in part, in all of us.\nWhat do I think we should do?\nThe same thing that's always\ndone in these cases:\nchanges are made looking forward;\nchildren are taught the new rules,\nthose of us who don't want to adapt\ncan write the way we're used to writing,\nand hopefully, time will cement\nthe new rules in place.\nThe success of every spelling reform\nthat affects deeply rooted habits\nlies in caution, agreement,\ngradualism and tolerance.\nAt the same time, can't allow\nthe attachment to old customs\nimpede us from moving forward.\nThe best tribute we can pay to the past\nis to improve upon what it's given us.\n\n\n\n15:36\n\n\nSo I believe that we must\nreach an agreement,\nthat academies must reach an agreement,\nand purge from our spelling rules\nall the habits we practice\njust for the sake of tradition,\neven if they are useless now.\nI'm convinced that if we do that\nin the humble but extremely\nimportant realm of language,\nwe'll be leaving a better future\nto the next generations.\n\n\n\n16:04\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'd like to start with a simple question:\nWhy do the poor make\nso many poor decisions?\nI know it's a harsh question,\nbut take a look at the data.\nThe poor borrow more, save less,\nsmoke more, exercise less, drink more\nand eat less healthfully.\nWhy?\n\n\n\n 0:35\n\n\nWell, the standard explanation\nwas once summed up by the British\nPrime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.\nAnd she called poverty\n\"a personality defect.\"\n\n\n\n 0:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:45\n\n\nA lack of character, basically.\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\nNow, I'm sure not many of you\nwould be so blunt.\nBut the idea that there's something\nwrong with the poor themselves\nis not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.\nSome of you may believe that the poor\nshould be held responsible\nfor their own mistakes.\nAnd others may argue that we should\nhelp them to make better decisions.\nBut the underlying assumption is the same:\nthere's something wrong with them.\nIf we could just change them,\nif we could just teach them\nhow to live their lives,\nif they would only listen.\nAnd to be honest,\nthis was what I thought for a long time.\nIt was only a few years ago\nthat I discovered\nthat everything I thought I knew\nabout poverty was wrong.\n\n\n\n 1:37\n\n\nIt all started when I accidentally\nstumbled upon a paper\nby a few American psychologists.\nThey had traveled 8,000 miles,\nall the way to India,\nfor a fascinating study.\nAnd it was an experiment\nwith sugarcane farmers.\nYou should know that these farmers\ncollect about 60 percent\nof their annual income all at once,\nright after the harvest.\nThis means that they're relatively\npoor one part of the year\nand rich the other.\nThe researchers asked them to do\nan IQ test before and after the harvest.\nWhat they subsequently discovered\ncompletely blew my mind.\nThe farmers scored much worse\non the test before the harvest.\nThe effects of living\nin poverty, it turns out,\ncorrespond to losing 14 points of IQ.\nNow, to give you an idea,\nthat's comparable\nto losing a night's sleep\nor the effects of alcoholism.\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nA few months later,\nI heard that Eldar Shafir,\na professor at Princeton University\nand one of the authors of this study,\nwas coming over to Holland, where I live.\nSo we met up in Amsterdam\nto talk about his revolutionary\nnew theory of poverty.\nAnd I can sum it up in just two words:\nscarcity mentality.\nIt turns out that people\nbehave differently\nwhen they perceive a thing to be scarce.\nAnd what that thing is\ndoesn't much matter —\nwhether it's not enough time,\nmoney or food.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nYou all know this feeling,\nwhen you've got too much to do,\nor when you've put off breaking for lunch\nand your blood sugar takes a dive.\nThis narrows your focus\nto your immediate lack —\nto the sandwich you've got to have now,\nthe meeting that's starting\nin five minutes\nor the bills that have\nto be paid tomorrow.\nSo the long-term perspective\ngoes out the window.\nYou could compare it to a new computer\nthat's running 10 heavy programs at once.\nIt gets slower and slower, making errors.\nEventually, it freezes —\nnot because it's a bad computer,\nbut because it has too much to do at once.\nThe poor have the same problem.\nThey're not making dumb decisions\nbecause they are dumb,\nbut because they're living in a context\nin which anyone would make dumb decisions.\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nSo suddenly I understood\nwhy so many of our anti-poverty\nprograms don't work.\nInvestments in education, for example,\nare often completely ineffective.\nPoverty is not a lack of knowledge.\nA recent analysis of 201 studies\non the effectiveness\nof money-management training\ncame to the conclusion\nthat it has almost no effect at all.\nNow, don't get me wrong —\nthis is not to say the poor\ndon't learn anything —\nthey can come out wiser for sure.\nBut it's not enough.\nOr as Professor Shafir told me,\n\"It's like teaching someone to swim\nand then throwing them in a stormy sea.\"\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\nI still remember sitting there,\nperplexed.\nAnd it struck me\nthat we could have figured\nthis all out decades ago.\nI mean, these psychologists didn't need\nany complicated brain scans;\nthey only had to measure the farmer's IQ,\nand IQ tests were invented\nmore than 100 years ago.\nActually, I realized I had read about\nthe psychology of poverty before.\nGeorge Orwell, one of the greatest\nwriters who ever lived,\nexperienced poverty\nfirsthand in the 1920s.\n\"The essence of poverty,\"\nhe wrote back then,\nis that it \"annihilates the future.\"\nAnd he marveled at, quote,\n\"How people take it for granted\nthey have the right to preach at you\nand pray over you\nas soon as your income falls\nbelow a certain level.\"\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nNow, those words are every bit\nas resonant today.\nThe big question is, of course:\nWhat can be done?\nModern economists have\na few solutions up their sleeves.\nWe could help the poor\nwith their paperwork\nor send them a text message\nto remind them to pay their bills.\nThis type of solution is hugely popular\nwith modern politicians,\nmostly because,\nwell, they cost next to nothing.\nThese solutions are, I think,\na symbol of this era\nin which we so often treat the symptoms,\nbut ignore the underlying cause.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nSo I wonder:\nWhy don't we just change the context\nin which the poor live?\nOr, going back to our computer analogy:\nWhy keep tinkering around\nwith the software\nwhen we can easily solve the problem\nby installing some extra memory instead?\nAt that point, Professor Shafir\nresponded with a blank look.\nAnd after a few seconds, he said,\n\"Oh, I get it.\nYou mean you want to just hand out\nmore money to the poor\nto eradicate poverty.\nUh, sure, that'd be great.\nBut I'm afraid that brand\nof left-wing politics\nyou've got in Amsterdam —\nit doesn't exist in the States.\"\n\n\n\n 6:37\n\n\nBut is this really\nan old-fashioned, leftist idea?\nI remembered reading about an old plan —\nsomething that has been proposed\nby some of history's leading thinkers.\nThe philosopher Thomas More\nfirst hinted at it in his book, \"Utopia,\"\nmore than 500 years ago.\nAnd its proponents have spanned\nthe spectrum from the left to the right,\nfrom the civil rights campaigner,\nMartin Luther King,\nto the economist Milton Friedman.\nAnd it's an incredibly simple idea:\nbasic income guarantee.\n\n\n\n 7:12\n\n\nWhat it is?\nWell, that's easy.\nIt's a monthly grant, enough to pay\nfor your basic needs:\nfood, shelter, education.\nIt's completely unconditional,\nso no one's going to tell you\nwhat you have to do for it,\nand no one's going to tell you\nwhat you have to do with it.\nThe basic income\nis not a favor, but a right.\nThere's absolutely no stigma attached.\nSo as I learned about the true\nnature of poverty,\nI couldn't stop wondering:\nIs this the idea\nwe've all been waiting for?\nCould it really be that simple?\nAnd in the three years that followed,\nI read everything I could find\nabout basic income.\nI researched the dozens of experiments\nthat have been conducted\nall over the globe,\nand it didn't take long before I stumbled\nupon a story of a town\nthat had done it —\nhad actually eradicated poverty.\nBut then ...\nnearly everyone forgot about it.\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nThis story starts in Dauphin, Canada.\nIn 1974, everybody in this small town\nwas guaranteed a basic income,\nensuring that no one fell\nbelow the poverty line.\nAt the start of the experiment,\nan army of researchers\ndescended on the town.\nFor four years, all went well.\nBut then a new government\nwas voted into power,\nand the new Canadian cabinet saw\nlittle point to the expensive experiment.\nSo when it became clear there was\nno money left to analyze the results,\nthe researchers decided to pack\ntheir files away in some 2,000 boxes.\nTwenty-five years went by,\nand then Evelyn Forget,\na Canadian professor,\nfound the records.\nFor three years, she subjected the data\nto all manner of statistical analysis,\nand no matter what she tried,\nthe results were the same every time:\nthe experiment had been\na resounding success.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nEvelyn Forget discovered\nthat the people in Dauphin\nhad not only become richer\nbut also smarter and healthier.\nThe school performance of kids\nimproved substantially.\nThe hospitalization rate decreased\nby as much as 8.5 percent.\nDomestic violence incidents were down,\nas were mental health complaints.\nAnd people didn't quit their jobs.\nThe only ones who worked a little less\nwere new mothers and students —\nwho stayed in school longer.\nSimilar results have since been found\nin countless other experiments\naround the globe,\nfrom the US to India.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nSo ...\nhere's what I've learned.\nWhen it comes to poverty,\nwe, the rich, should stop\npretending we know best.\nWe should stop sending shoes\nand teddy bears to the poor,\nto people we have never met.\nAnd we should get rid of the vast\nindustry of paternalistic bureaucrats\nwhen we could simply\nhand over their salaries\nto the poor they're supposed to help.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:07\n\n\nBecause, I mean, the great\nthing about money\nis that people can use it\nto buy things they need\ninstead of things that self-appointed\nexperts think they need.\nJust imagine how many brilliant scientists\nand entrepreneurs and writers,\nlike George Orwell,\nare now withering away in scarcity.\nImagine how much energy\nand talent we would unleash\nif we got rid of poverty once and for all.\nI believe that a basic income would work\nlike venture capital for the people.\nAnd we can't afford not to do it,\nbecause poverty is hugely expensive.\nJust look at the cost of child poverty\nin the US, for example.\nIt's estimated at 500 billion\ndollars each year,\nin terms of higher health care\nspending, higher dropout rates,\nand more crime.\nNow, this is an incredible waste\nof human potential.\n\n\n\n10:59\n\n\nBut let's talk about\nthe elephant in the room.\nHow could we ever afford\na basic income guarantee?\nWell, it's actually a lot cheaper\nthan you may think.\nWhat they did in Dauphin is finance it\nwith a negative income tax.\nThis means that your income is topped up\nas soon as you fall\nbelow the poverty line.\nAnd in that scenario,\naccording to our economists'\nbest estimates,\nfor a net cost of 175 billion —\na quarter of US military spending,\none percent of GDP —\nyou could lift all impoverished Americans\nabove the poverty line.\nYou could actually eradicate poverty.\nNow, that should be our goal.\n\n\n\n11:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:40\n\n\nThe time for small thoughts\nand little nudges is past.\nI really believe that the time has come\nfor radical new ideas,\nand basic income is so much more\nthan just another policy.\nIt is also a complete rethink\nof what work actually is.\nAnd in that sense,\nit will not only free the poor,\nbut also the rest of us.\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\nNowadays, millions of people feel\nthat their jobs have little\nmeaning or significance.\nA recent poll among 230,000 employees\nin 142 countries\nfound that only 13 percent of workers\nactually like their job.\nAnd another poll found that as much\nas 37 percent of British workers\nhave a job that they think\ndoesn't even need to exist.\nIt's like Brad Pitt says in \"Fight Club,\"\n\"Too often we're working jobs we hate\nso we can buy shit we don't need.\"\n\n\n\n12:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:32\n\n\nNow, don't get me wrong —\nI'm not talking about the teachers\nand the garbagemen\nand the care workers here.\nIf they stopped working,\nwe'd be in trouble.\nI'm talking about all those well-paid\nprofessionals with excellent résumés\nwho earn their money doing ...\nstrategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings\nwhile brainstorming the value\nadd-on of disruptive co-creation\nin the network society.\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:54\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:55\n\n\nOr something like that.\nJust imagine again how much\ntalent we're wasting,\nsimply because we tell our kids\nthey'll have to \"earn a living.\"\nOr think of what a math whiz working\nat Facebook lamented a few years ago:\n\"The best minds of my generation\nare thinking about how\nto make people click ads.\"\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nI'm a historian.\nAnd if history teaches us anything,\nit is that things could be different.\nThere is nothing inevitable\nabout the way we structured our society\nand economy right now.\nIdeas can and do change the world.\nAnd I think that especially\nin the past few years,\nit has become abundantly clear\nthat we cannot stick to the status quo —\nthat we need new ideas.\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\nI know that many of you\nmay feel pessimistic\nabout a future of rising inequality,\nxenophobia\nand climate change.\nBut it's not enough\nto know what we're against.\nWe also need to be for something.\nMartin Luther King didn't say,\n\"I have a nightmare.\"\n\n\n\n13:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:56\n\n\nHe had a dream.\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:58\n\n\nSo ...\nhere's my dream:\nI believe in a future\nwhere the value of your work\nis not determined\nby the size of your paycheck,\nbut by the amount of happiness you spread\nand the amount of meaning you give.\nI believe in a future\nwhere the point of education is not\nto prepare you for another useless job\nbut for a life well-lived.\nI believe in a future\nwhere an existence\nwithout poverty is not a privilege\nbut a right we all deserve.\nSo here we are.\nHere we are.\nWe've got the research,\nwe've got the evidence\nand we've got the means.\n\n\n\n14:32\n\n\nNow, more than 500 years after Thomas More\nfirst wrote about a basic income,\nand 100 years after George Orwell\ndiscovered the true nature of poverty,\nwe all need to change our worldview,\nbecause poverty\nis not a lack of character.\nPoverty is a lack of cash.\n\n\n\n14:50\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n14:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhy do we think\nthat stories by men are deemed\nto be of universal importance,\nand stories by women are thought\nto be merely about women?\n\n\n\n 0:25\n\n\nMy grandmother left school\nwhen she was 12.\nShe had 14 children.\nMy mother left school when she was 15.\nShe was a secretary.\nI graduated from university\nto become a theater director,\nand that progress is entirely to do\nwith the fact that people I'll never meet\nfought for women to have rights,\nget the vote, get education,\nhave progress.\nAnd I'm determined to do the same,\nand obviously you are, too.\nWhy not?\n\n\n\n 0:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 0:54\n\n\nSo I started a festival called WOW,\nWomen of the World, seven years ago,\nand it's now in 20 countries\nacross five continents.\nAnd one of those countries\nis Somaliland in Africa.\nSo I traveled there last year,\nand part of the joy I had in going there\nwas going to these caves.\nThe Laas Geel caves.\nNow, these caves contain some\nof the oldest cave paintings in the world.\nThese paintings are thought to be\nround about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.\nArt:\nwhat humanity has done\never since it evolved.\nIt's how we speak about ourselves,\nhow we understand our identity,\nhow we look at our surroundings,\nwho we find out about each other\nbecause of the meaning of our lives.\nThat's what art is for.\n\n\n\n 1:46\n\n\nSo look at this little picture.\nI think it's a little girl.\nI thought it was a bit like me\nwhen I was a little girl.\nAnd I thought, well, who painted\nthis joyful, youthful figure?\nAnd I asked the curator of the caves.\nI said, \"Tell me about the men\nand women who painted these.\"\nAnd he looked at me\nabsolutely askance, and he said,\n\"Women didn't paint these pictures.\"\nAnd I said, \"Well,\nit was 11,000 years ago.\"\nI said, \"How do you know?\"\n\n\n\n 2:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nAnd he said, \"Women don't do these things.\nMen made these marks. Women don't.\"\n\n\n\n 2:25\n\n\nNow, I wasn't really surprised,\nbecause that's an attitude\nthat I've seen continuously\nall my life as a theater maker.\nWe are told that divine knowledge\ncomes down through the masculine,\nwhether it be to the imam,\nthe priest, the rabbi, the holy man.\nSimilarly, we're told that creative genius\nresides in the masculine,\nthat it is the masculine\nthat will be able to tell us\nabout who we really are,\nthat the masculine will tell\nthe universal story\non behalf of all of us,\nwhereas women artists will really\njust talk about women's experiences,\nwomen's issues\nonly really relevant to women\nand of passing interest to men —\nand really only some men.\nAnd it's that conviction,\nthat that we are taught,\nthat I think colors so much\nof whether we're prepared to believe\nthat women's stories really matter.\nAnd unless we're prepared to believe\nthat women's stories really matter,\nthen women's rights don't really matter,\nand then change can't really come.\n\n\n\n 3:37\n\n\nI want to tell you\nabout two examples of stories\nthat are thought to be\nof universal importance:\n\"E.T.\" and \"Hamlet.\"\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:51\n\n\nSo I took my two children\nwhen they were little —\nCaroline was eight and Robby was five —\nto see \"E.T.\"\nAnd it's a fantastic story\nof this little alien\nwho ends up in an American family\nwith a mum, two brothers and a sister,\nbut he wants to go home.\nNot only that, but some\nreally bad scientists\nwant to do some experiments on him,\nand they're looking for him.\nSo the children have a plot.\nThey decide they're going to take him\nback to his spaceship\nas soon as they can,\nand they plop him in a bicycle basket,\nand off they ride.\nBut unfortunately, the baddies\nhave found out, and they're catching up\nand they've got sirens\nand they've got their guns,\nthey've got the loud-hailers,\nit's terribly frightening,\nand they're closing up on the children,\nand the children are never\ngoing to make it.\nAnd then all of a sudden, magically,\nthe bikes fly up in the air,\nover the clouds,\nover the moon,\nand they're going to save \"E.T.\"\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\nSo I turn to see my children's faces,\nand Robby is enraptured,\nhe's there with them, he's saving E.T.,\nhe's a happy boy.\nAnd I turn to Caroline,\nand she's crying her eyes out.\nAnd I said, \"What's the matter?\"\nAnd she said, \"Why can't I save E.T.?\nWhy can't I come?\"\nAnd then all of a sudden I realized:\nthey weren't children;\nthey were boys —\nall boys.\nAnd Caroline, who had invested\nso much in E.T.,\nwell, she wasn't invited to save him,\nand she felt humiliated and spurned.\n\n\n\n 5:27\n\n\nSo I wrote to Steven Spielberg —\n\n\n\n 5:29\n\n\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:35\n\n\nand I said, \"I don't know\nif you understand\nthe psychological importance\nof what's happened,\nand are you prepared to pay\nfor the therapy bills?\"\n\n\n\n 5:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:44\n\n\nTwenty years later, I haven't\nhad a word back from him,\nbut I'm still hopeful.\n\n\n\n 5:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nBut I thought it was interesting,\nbecause if you read reviews\nof what he intended with E.T.,\nhe says very specifically,\n\"I wanted the world to understand\nthat we should love\nand embrace difference.\"\nBut somehow he didn't include\nthe idea of girls' difference\nin this thinking.\nHe thought he was writing a story\nabout all humanity.\nCaroline thought he was marginalizing\nhalf of humanity.\nHe thought he was writing a story\nabout human goodness;\nshe thought he was writing\na lad's heroic adventure.\n\n\n\n 6:25\n\n\nAnd this is common.\nMen feel they have been given the mantle\nfor universal communication,\nbut of course, how could they be?\nThey are writing from male experience\nthrough male's eyes.\nWe have to have a look at this ourselves.\nWe have to be prepared to go back\nthrough all our books and our films,\nall our favorite things,\nand say, \"Actually, this is written\nby a male artist —\nnot an artist.\nWe have to see\nthat so many of these stories\nare written through a male perspective.\nWhich is fine,\nbut then females need to have\n50 percent of the rights\nfor the stage, the film, the novel,\nthe place of creativity.\n\n\n\n 7:08\n\n\nLet me talk about \"Hamlet.\"\nTo be or not to be.\nThat is the question.\nBut it's not my question.\nMy question is: Why was I taught\nas a young woman\nthat this was the quintessential\nexample of human dilemma\nand human experience?\nIt's a marvelous story,\nbut actually, it's about a young man\nfearful that he won't be able to make it\nas a powerful figure in a male world\nunless he takes revenge\nfor his father's murder.\nHe talks a great deal to us\nabout suicide being an option,\nbut the reality is that the person\nwho actually commits suicide, Ophelia,\nafter she's been humiliated\nand abused by him,\nnever gets a chance to talk\nto the audience about her feelings.\nAnd then when he's finished with Ophelia,\nhe turns on his mum,\nbecause basically she has the audacity\nto fall in love with his uncle\nand enjoy sex.\n\n\n\n 8:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\nIt is a great story,\nbut it is a story about male conflict,\nmale dilemma, male struggle.\nBut I was told this was the story\nof human beings,\ndespite the fact that it only\nhad two women in it.\nAnd unless I reeducate myself,\nI am always going to think\nthat women's stories\nmatter less than men's.\nA woman could have written \"Hamlet,\"\nbut she would have written it differently,\nand it wouldn't have had\nglobal recognition.\nAs the writer Margaret Atwood says,\n\"When a man writes about doing the dishes,\nit's realism.\nWhen a woman writes about doing it,\nit's an unfortunate genetic disposition.\"\n\n\n\n 8:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:46\n\n\nNow, this is not just something\nthat belongs to then.\nI mean, when I was a young girl,\nwanting desperately\nto be a theater director,\nthis is what my male lecturer said to me:\n\"Well, there are three women\ndirectors in Britain,\" he said, \"Jude.\"\n\"There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian,\nthere's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,\nand there's Buzz Goodbody,\nwho's just killed herself.\nSo, which of those three\nwould you like to be?\"\n\n\n\n 9:10\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:11\n\n\nNow, leaving aside\nthe disgusting slur on gay women,\nthe fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.\nHe thought it was silly\nthat I wanted to be a director.\nAnd I told my friend Marin Alsop,\nthe conductor, and she said,\n\"Oh yes, well, my music teacher\nsaid exactly the same.\nHe said, 'Women don't conduct.'\"\nBut all these years later,\nwe've made our mark.\nYou think, \"Well, it'll be different now.\"\nI'm afraid it's not different now.\nThe current head\nof the Paris Conservatoire\nsaid recently, \"It takes\ngreat physical strength\nto conduct a symphony,\nand women are too weak.\"\n\n\n\n 9:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:50\n\n\nThe artist George Baselitz said,\n\"Well, the fact is women can't paint.\nWell — they can't paint very well.\"\n\n\n\n 9:57\n\n\nThe writer V.S. Naipaul\nsaid two years ago,\n\"I can read two paragraphs and know\nimmediately if it's written by a woman,\nand I just stop reading,\nbecause it's not worthy of me.\"\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nAudience: Whoa!\n\n\n\n10:08\n\n\nAnd it goes on.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nWe have to find a way\nof stopping young girls and women\nfeeling not only that\ntheir story doesn't matter,\nbut they're not allowed\nto be the storyteller.\nBecause once you feel\nthat you can't stand in the central space\nand speak on behalf of the world,\nyou will feel that you can offer\nyour goods up to a small, select group.\nYou will tend to do smaller work\non smaller stages,\nyour economic power will be less,\nyour reach of audiences will be less,\nand your credit will be less as an artist.\nAnd we do finally give artists\nthese incredible, prominent spaces\nin the world,\nbecause they are our storytellers.\n\n\n\n10:56\n\n\nNow, why should it matter to you\nif you're not an artist?\nSupposing you're an accountant\nor an entrepreneur or a medic\nor a scientist:\nShould you care about women artists?\nAbsolutely, you must,\nbecause as you can see\nfrom the cave paintings,\nall civilizations,\nall of humanity\nhave relied upon artists\nto tell the human story,\nand if the human story\nis finally told by men,\ntake my word for it,\nit will be about men.\n\n\n\n11:28\n\n\nSo let's make a change.\nLet's make a change\nto all our institutions,\nand not just in the West.\nDon't forget — this message\nof incapability of women\nto hold creative genius\nis being told to girls and women\nin Nigeria, in China, in Russia,\nin Indonesia.\nAll over the world, girls\nand women are being told\nthat they can't finally hold the idea\nof creative inspiration.\nAnd I want to ask you:\nDo you believe that?\nDo you believe that women\ncan be a creative genius?\n\n\n\n12:04\n\n\n(Applause and cheers)\n\n\n\n12:09\n\n\nWell then, please go forward,\nsupport women artists,\nbuy their work,\ninsist that their voices are heard,\nfind platforms on which\ntheir voices will be made.\nAnd remember this:\nthat in a sense, if we're going\nto get past this moment\nof a world where we know\nthat we are unequal,\nit's artists who have to imagine\na different world.\nAnd I'm calling on all artists,\nwomen and men,\nto imagine a gender-equal world.\nLet's paint it. Let's draw it.\nLet's write about it. Let's film it.\nAnd if we could imagine it,\nthen we would have the energy\nand the stamina\nto work towards it.\n\n\n\n12:52\n\n\nWhen I see this little girl,\n11,000 years ago,\nI want to know that the little girl now\ncan stand there and think\nshe's entitled to her dreams,\nshe's entitled to her destiny\nand she's entitled to speak\non behalf of the whole world,\nbe recognized for it\nand applauded.\n\n\n\n13:13\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:16\n\n\nLet me introduce to you Rezero.\nThis little fellow was developed\nby a group of 10 undergraduate students\nat the Autonomous Systems Laboratory\nat ETH-Zurich.\n\n\n\n 0:27\n\n\nOur robot belongs to a family of robots\ncalled Ballbots.\nInstead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing\nand moving on one single ball.\nThe main characteristics of such a system is\nthat there's one sole contact point to the ground.\nThis means that the robot\nis inherently unstable.\nIt's like when I am trying to stand\non one foot.\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nYou might ask yourself, what's the usefulness\nof a robot that's unstable?\nNow we'll explain that in a second.\nLet me first explain how Rezero\nactually keeps his balance.\nRezero keeps his balance by constantly\nmeasuring his pitch angle with a sensor.\nHe then counteracts and avoids toppling over\nby turning the motors appropriately.\nThis happens 160 times per second,\nand if anything fails in this process,\nRezero would immediately fall to the ground.\n\n\n\n 1:14\n\n\nNow to move and to balance,\nRezero needs to turn the ball.\nThe ball is driven by three special wheels\nthat allow Rezero to move into any direction\nand also move around his own axis\nat the same time.\nDue to his instability, Rezero is always\nin motion. Now here's the trick.\nIt's indeed exactly this instability that allows\na robot to move very [dynamically].\nLet's play a little.\nYou may have wondered what happens\nif I give the robot a little push.\nIn this mode, he's trying to maintain\nhis position.\n\n\n\n 1:52\n\n\nFor the next demo, I'd like you to introduce\nto my colleagues Michael, on the computer,\nand Thomas who's helping me onstage.\nIn the next mode, Rezero is passive,\nand we can move him around.\nWith almost no force I can control\nhis position and his velocity.\nI can also make him spin.\nIn the next mode, we can get Rezero\nto follow a person.\nHe's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.\nThis works with a laser sensor\nthat's mounted on top of Rezero.\nWith the same method, we can also\nget him to circle a person.\nWe call this the orbiting mode.\nAll right, thank you, Thomas.\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 3:16\n\n\nNow, what's the use of this technology?\nFor now, it's an experiment, but let me\nshow you some possible future applications.\nRezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.\nWith a screen it could inform people or show\nthem around in a fun and entertaining way.\nIn a hospital, this device could be used to\ncarry around medical equipment.\nDue to the Ballbot system, it has a very small\nfootprint and it's also easy to move around.\nAnd of course, who wouldn't like\nto take a ride on one of these.\nAnd these are more practical applications.\nBut there's also a certain beauty\nwithin this technology.\n\n\n\n 3:55\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 5:01\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:05\n\n\nThank you.\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was obsessed\nwith the Guinness Book of World Records,\nand I really wanted\nto set a world record myself.\nBut there was just one small problem:\nI had absolutely no talent.\nSo I decided to set\na world record in something\nthat demanded absolutely no skill at all.\nI decided to set a world record\nin crawling.\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\nNow, the record at the time\nwas 12 and a half miles,\nand for some reason,\nthis seemed totally manageable.\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\nI recruited my friend Anne,\nand together we decided,\nwe didn't even need to train.\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nAnd on the day of our record attempt,\nwe put furniture pads\non the outside of our good luck jeans\nand we set off,\nand right away, we were in trouble,\nbecause the denim was against our skin\nand it began to chafe,\nand soon our knees were being chewed up.\nHours in,\nit began to rain.\nThen, Anne dropped out.\nThen, it got dark.\nNow, by now, my knees\nwere bleeding through my jeans,\nand I was hallucinating from the cold\nand the pain and the monotony.\nAnd to give you an idea\nof the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,\nthe first lap around\nthe high school track took 10 minutes.\nThe last lap took almost 30.\n\n\n\n 1:53\n\n\nAfter 12 hours of crawling,\nI stopped,\nand I had gone eight and a half miles.\nSo I was short of\nthe 12-and-a-half-mile record.\n\n\n\n 2:06\n\n\nNow, for many years, I thought\nthis was a story of abject failure,\nbut today I see it differently,\nbecause when I was\nattempting the world record,\nI was doing three things.\nI was getting outside my comfort zone,\nI was calling upon my resilience,\nand I was finding confidence in myself\nand my own decisions.\nI didn't know it then,\nbut those are not\nthe attributes of failure.\nThose are the attributes of bravery.\n\n\n\n 2:36\n\n\nNow, in 1989, at the age of 26,\nI became a San Francisco firefighter,\nand I was the 15th woman\nin a department of 1,500 men.\n\n\n\n 2:46\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:52\n\n\nAnd as you can imagine, when I arrived\nthere were many doubts\nabout whether we could do the job.\nSo even though I was a 5'10\",\n150-pound collegiate rower,\nand someone who could endure\n12 hours of searing knee pain —\n\n\n\n 3:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\nI knew I still had to prove\nmy strength and fitness.\n\n\n\n 3:11\n\n\nSo one day a call came in for a fire,\nand sure enough,\nwhen my engine group pulled up,\nthere was black smoke billowing\nfrom a building off an alleyway.\nAnd I was with a big guy named Skip,\nand he was on the nozzle,\nand I was right behind,\nand it was a typical sort of fire.\nIt was smoky, it was hot,\nand all of a sudden,\nthere was an explosion,\nand Skip and I were blown backwards,\nmy mask was knocked sideways,\nand there was this moment of confusion.\nAnd then I picked myself up,\nI groped for the nozzle,\nand I did what a firefighter\nwas supposed to do:\nI lunged forward,\nopened up the water\nand I tackled the fire myself.\nThe explosion had been caused\nby a water heater,\nso nobody was hurt,\nand ultimately it was not a big deal,\nbut later Skip came up to me and said,\n\"Nice job, Caroline,\"\nin this surprised sort of voice.\n\n\n\n 4:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:08\n\n\nAnd I was confused, because\nthe fire hadn't been difficult physically,\nso why was he looking at me\nwith something like astonishment?\nAnd then it became clear:\nSkip, who was by the way a really nice guy\nand an excellent firefighter,\nnot only thought\nthat women could not be strong,\nhe thought that they\ncould not be brave either.\nAnd he wasn't the only one.\nFriends, acquaintances and strangers,\nmen and women throughout my career\nask me over and over,\n\"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,\naren't you scared?\"\nHonestly, I never heard\na male firefighter asked this.\nAnd I became curious.\nWhy wasn't bravery expected of women?\n\n\n\n 4:56\n\n\nNow, the answer began to come\nwhen a friend of mine lamented to me\nthat her young daughter\nwas a big scaredy-cat,\nand so I began to notice,\nand yes, the daughter was anxious,\nbut more than that,\nthe parents were anxious.\nMost of what they said to her\nwhen she was outside began with,\n\"Be careful,\" \"Watch out,\" or \"No.\"\nNow, my friends were not bad parents.\nThey were just doing what most parents do,\nwhich is cautioning their daughters\nmuch more than they caution their sons.\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nThere was a study involving\na playground fire pole, ironically,\nin which researchers saw that little girls\nwere very likely to be warned\nby both their moms and dads\nabout the fire pole's risk,\nand if the little girls\nstill wanted to play on the fire pole,\na parent was very likely to assist her.\nBut the little boys?\nThey were encouraged\nto play on the fire pole\ndespite any trepidations\nthat they might have,\nand often the parents offered\nguidance on how to use it on their own.\nSo what message does this send\nto both boys and girls?\nWell, that girls are fragile\nand more in need of help,\nand that boys can and should\nmaster difficult tasks by themselves.\nIt says that girls should be fearful\nand boys should be gutsy.\n\n\n\n 6:24\n\n\nNow, the irony is that at this young age,\ngirls and boys are actually\nvery alike physically.\nIn fact, girls are often\nstronger until puberty,\nand more mature.\nAnd yet we adults act\nas if girls are more fragile\nand more in need of help,\nand they can't handle as much.\nThis is the message\nthat we absorb as kids,\nand this is the message\nthat fully permeates as we grow up.\nWe women believe it, men believe it,\nand guess what?\nAs we become parents,\nwe pass it on to our children,\nand so it goes.\n\n\n\n 6:57\n\n\nWell, so now I had my answer.\nThis is why women, even firewomen,\nwere expected to be scared.\nThis is why women often are scared.\n\n\n\n 7:08\n\n\nNow, I know some of you\nwon't believe me when I tell you this,\nbut I am not against fear.\nI know it's an important emotion,\nand it's there to keep us safe.\nBut the problem is\nwhen fear is the primary reaction\nthat we teach and encourage in girls\nwhenever they face something\noutside their comfort zone.\n\n\n\n 7:28\n\n\nSo I was a paraglider pilot\nfor many years —\n\n\n\n 7:32\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 7:34\n\n\nand a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,\nand it does fly very well,\nbut to many people I realize\nit looks just like a bedsheet\nwith strings attached.\n\n\n\n 7:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:46\n\n\nAnd I spent a lot of time on mountaintops\ninflating this bedsheet,\nrunning off and flying.\nAnd I know what you're thinking.\nYou're like, Caroline,\na little fear would make sense here.\nAnd you're right, it does.\nI assure you, I did feel fear.\nBut on that mountaintop,\nwaiting for the wind\nto come in just right,\nI felt so many other things, too:\nexhilaration, confidence.\nI knew I was a good pilot.\nI knew the conditions were good,\nor I wouldn't be there.\nI knew how great it was going to be\na thousand feet in the air.\nSo yes, fear was there,\nbut I would take a good hard look at it,\nassess just how relevant it was\nand then put it where it belonged,\nwhich was more often than not\nbehind my exhilaration, my anticipation\nand my confidence.\nSo I'm not against fear.\nI'm just pro-bravery.\n\n\n\n 8:45\n\n\nNow, I'm not saying\nyour girls must be firefighters\nor that they should be paragliders,\nbut I am saying that we are raising\nour girls to be timid, even helpless,\nand it begins when we caution them\nagainst physical risk.\nThe fear we learn\nand the experiences we don't\nstay with us as we become women\nand morphs into all those things\nthat we face and try to shed:\nour hesitation in speaking out,\nour deference so that we can be liked\nand our lack of confidence\nin our own decisions.\n\n\n\n 9:17\n\n\nSo how do we become brave?\nWell, here's the good news.\nBravery is learned,\nand like anything learned,\nit just needs to be practiced.\nSo first,\nwe have to take a deep breath\nand encourage our girls\nto skateboard, climb trees\nand clamber around\non that playground fire pole.\nThis is what my own mother did.\nShe didn't know it then,\nbut researchers have a name for this.\nThey call it risky play,\nand studies show that risky play\nis really important for kids, all kids,\nbecause it teaches hazard assessment,\nit teaches delayed gratification,\nit teaches resilience,\nit teaches confidence.\nIn other words,\nwhen kids get outside\nand practice bravery,\nthey learn valuable life lessons.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nSecond, we have to stop\ncautioning our girls willy-nilly.\nSo notice next time you say,\n\"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,\"\nor, \"Don't do that, it's dangerous.\"\nAnd remember that often\nwhat you're really telling her\nis that she shouldn't be pushing herself,\nthat she's really not good enough,\nthat she should be afraid.\n\n\n\n10:35\n\n\nThird,\nwe women have to start\npracticing bravery, too.\nWe cannot teach our girls\nuntil we teach ourselves.\nSo here's another thing:\nfear and exhilaration\nfeel very similar —\nthe shaky hands,\nthe heightened heart rate,\nthe nervous tension,\nand I'm betting that for many of you\nthe last time you thought\nyou were scared out of your wits,\nyou may have been feeling\nmostly exhilaration,\nand now you've missed an opportunity.\nSo practice.\nAnd while girls should be getting\noutside to learn to be gutsy,\nI get that adults don't want\nto get on hoverboards or climb trees,\nso we all should be practicing\nat home, in the office\nand even right here getting up the guts\nto talk to someone that you really admire.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\n\nFinally, when your girl is, let's say,\non her bike on the top of the steep hill\nthat she insists\nshe's too scared to go down,\nguide her to access her bravery.\nUltimately, maybe that hill\nreally is too steep,\nbut she'll come to that conclusion\nthrough courage, not fear.\nBecause this is not\nabout the steep hill in front of her.\nThis is about the life ahead of her\nand that she has the tools\nto handle and assess\nall the dangers\nthat we cannot protect her from,\nall the challenges that we won't\nbe there to guide her through,\neverything that our girls here\nand around the world\nface in their future.\n\n\n\n12:17\n\n\nSo by the way,\nthe world record for crawling today —\n\n\n\n12:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:24\n\n\nis 35.18 miles,\nand I would really love\nto see a girl go break that.\n\n\n\n12:33\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'm here to spread the word about the\nmagnificence of spiders\nand how much we can learn from them.\nSpiders are truly global citizens.\nYou can find spiders in nearly\nevery terrestrial habitat.\nThis red dot marks\nthe Great Basin of North America,\nand I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity\nproject there with some collaborators.\nHere's one of our field sites,\nand just to give you a sense of perspective,\nthis little blue smudge here,\nthat's one of my collaborators.\nThis is a rugged and barren landscape,\nyet there are quite a few spiders here.\nTurning rocks over revealed this crab spider\ngrappling with a beetle.\n\n\n\n 0:52\n\n\nSpiders are not just everywhere,\nbut they're extremely diverse.\nThere are over 40,000 described species\nof spiders.\nTo put that number into perspective,\nhere's a graph comparing the 40,000\nspecies of spiders\nto the 400 species of primates.\nThere are two orders of magnitude more\nspiders than primates.\nSpiders are also extremely old.\nOn the bottom here,\nthis is the geologic timescale,\nand the numbers on it indicate millions\nof years from the present, so the zero here,\nthat would be today.\nSo what this figure shows is that spiders\ndate back to almost 380 million years.\nTo put that into perspective, this red\nvertical bar here marks the divergence time\nof humans from chimpanzees,\na mere seven million years ago.\n\n\n\n 1:45\n\n\nAll spiders make silk\nat some point in their life.\nMost spiders use copious amounts of silk,\nand silk is essential to their survival\nand reproduction.\nEven fossil spiders can make silk,\nas we can see from this impression of\na spinneret on this fossil spider.\nSo this means that both spiders\nand spider silk have been around\nfor 380 million years.\nIt doesn't take long from working with spiders\nto start noticing how essential silk is\nto just about every aspect of their life.\nSpiders use silk for many purposes, including\nthe trailing safety dragline,\nwrapping eggs for reproduction,\nprotective retreats\nand catching prey.\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nThere are many kinds of spider silk.\nFor example, this garden spider can make\nseven different kinds of silks.\nWhen you look at this orb web, you're actually\nseeing many types of silk fibers.\nThe frame and radii of this web\nis made up of one type of silk,\nwhile the capture spiral is a composite\nof two different silks:\nthe filament and the sticky droplet.\nHow does an individual spider\nmake so many kinds of silk?\nTo answer that, you have to look a lot closer\nat the spinneret region of a spider.\nSo silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for\nthose of us spider silk biologists, this is what\nwe call the \"business end\" of the spider. (Laughter)\nWe spend long days ...\nHey! Don't laugh. That's my life.\n(Laughter)\nWe spend long days and nights\nstaring at this part of the spider.\nAnd this is what we see.\nYou can see multiple fibers\ncoming out of the spinnerets, because\neach spinneret has many spigots on it.\nEach of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,\nand if you were to trace the fiber back\ninto the spider, what you would find is that\neach spigot connects to its own individual\nsilk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac\nwith a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.\nSo if you ever have the opportunity to dissect\nan orb-web-weaving spider,\nand I hope you do,\nwhat you would find is a bounty\nof beautiful, translucent silk glands.\n\n\n\n 4:02\n\n\nInside each spider, there are hundreds\nof silk glands, sometimes thousands.\nThese can be grouped into seven categories.\nThey differ by size, shape,\nand sometimes even color.\nIn an orb-web-weaving spider,\nyou can find seven types of silk glands,\nand what I have depicted here in this picture,\nlet's start at the one o'clock position,\nthere's tubuliform silk glands, which are used\nto make the outer silk of an egg sac.\nThere's the aggregate and flagelliform silk\nglands which combine to make the sticky\ncapture spiral of an orb web.\nPyriform silk glands make the attachment\ncement — that's the silk that's used to adhere\nsilk lines to a substrate.\nThere's also aciniform silk,\nwhich is used to wrap prey.\nMinor ampullate silk is used in web construction.\nAnd the most studied silk line\nof them all: major ampullate silk.\nThis is the silk that's used to make the frame\nand radii of an orb web, and also\nthe safety trailing dragline.\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\nBut what, exactly, is spider silk?\nSpider silk is almost entirely protein.\nNearly all of these proteins can be explained\nby a single gene family,\nso this means that the diversity of silk types\nwe see today is encoded by one gene family,\nso presumably the original spider ancestor\nmade one kind of silk,\nand over the last 380 million years,\nthat one silk gene has duplicated\nand then diverged, specialized,\nover and over and over again, to get\nthe large variety of flavors of spider silks\nthat we have today.\nThere are several features that all these silks\nhave in common. They all have a common\ndesign, such as they're all very long —\nthey're sort of outlandishly long\ncompared to other proteins.\nThey're very repetitive, and they're very rich\nin the amino acids glycine and alanine.\nTo give you an idea of what\na spider silk protein looks like,\nthis is a dragline silk protein,\nit's just a portion of it,\nfrom the black widow spider.\nThis is the kind of sequence that I love\nlooking at day and night. (Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\nSo what you're seeing here is the one letter\nabbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored\nin the glycines with green,\nand the alanines in red, and so\nyou can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.\nYou can also see that there's a lot of short\nsequence motifs that repeat over and over\nand over again, so for example there's a lot of\nwhat we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,\nAAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.\nYou can think of these short motifs\nthat repeat over and over again as words,\nand these words occur in sentences.\nSo for example this would be one sentence,\nand you would get this sort of green region\nand the red polyalanine, that repeats\nover and over and over again,\nand you can have that hundreds and\nhundreds and hundreds of times within\nan individual silk molecule.\n\n\n\n 7:02\n\n\nSilks made by the same spider can have\ndramatically different repeat sequences.\nAt the top of the screen, you're seeing\nthe repeat unit from the dragline silk\nof a garden argiope spider.\nIt's short. And on the bottom,\nthis is the repeat sequence for the\negg case, or tubuliform silk protein,\nfor the exact same spider. And you can see\nhow dramatically different\nthese silk proteins are — so this is\nsort of the beauty of the diversification\nof the spider silk gene family.\nYou can see that the repeat units differ\nin length. They also differ in sequence.\nSo I've colored in the glycines again\nin green, alanine in red, and the serines,\nthe letter S, in purple. And you can see\nthat the top repeat unit can be explained\nalmost entirely by green and red,\nand the bottom repeat unit has\na substantial amount of purple.\nWhat silk biologists do is we try to relate\nthese sequences, these amino acid\nsequences, to the mechanical properties\nof the silk fibers.\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nNow, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk\ncompletely outside their body.\nThis makes testing spider silk really, really\neasy to do in the laboratory, because\nwe're actually, you know, testing it in air\nthat's exactly the environment that\nspiders are using their silk proteins.\nSo this makes quantifying silk properties by\nmethods such as tensile testing, which is\nbasically, you know, tugging on one end\nof the fiber, very amenable.\nHere are stress-strain curves\ngenerated by tensile testing\nfive fibers made by the same spider.\nSo what you can see here is that\nthe five fibers have different behaviors.\nSpecifically, if you look on the vertical axis,\nthat's stress. If you look at the maximum\nstress value for each of these fibers,\nyou can see that there's a lot of variation,\nand in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,\nis the strongest of these fibers.\nWe think that's because the dragline silk,\nwhich is used to make the frame and radii\nfor a web, needs to be very strong.\n\n\n\n 9:06\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you were to look at\nstrain — this is how much a fiber can be\nextended — if you look at the maximum value\nhere, again, there's a lot of variation\nand the clear winner is flagelliform,\nor the capture spiral filament.\nIn fact, this flagelliform fiber can\nactually stretch over twice its original length.\nSo silk fibers vary in their strength\nand also their extensibility.\nIn the case of the capture spiral,\nit needs to be so stretchy to absorb\nthe impact of flying prey.\nIf it wasn't able to stretch so much, then\nbasically when an insect hit the web,\nit would just trampoline right off of it.\nSo if the web was made entirely out of\ndragline silk, an insect is very likely to just\nbounce right off. But by having really, really\nstretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually\nable to absorb the impact\nof that intercepted prey.\n\n\n\n 9:56\n\n\nThere's quite a bit of variation within\nthe fibers that an individual spider can make.\nWe call that the tool kit of a spider.\nThat's what the spider has\nto interact with their environment.\nBut how about variation among spider\nspecies, so looking at one type of silk\nand looking at different species of spiders?\nThis is an area that's largely unexplored\nbut here's a little bit of data I can show you.\nThis is the comparison of the toughness\nof the dragline spilk spun\nby 21 species of spiders.\nSome of them are orb-weaving spiders and\nsome of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.\nIt's been hypothesized that\norb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,\nshould have the toughest dragline silks\nbecause they must intercept flying prey.\nWhat you see here on this toughness graph\nis the higher the black dot is on the graph,\nthe higher the toughness.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\n\nThe 21 species are indicated here by this\nphylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows\ntheir genetic relationships, and I've colored\nin yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.\nIf you look right here at the two red arrows,\nthey point to the toughness values\nfor the draglines of nephila clavipes and\naraneus diadematus.\nThese are the two species of spiders\nfor which the vast majority of time and money\non synthetic spider silk research has been\nto replicate their dragline silk proteins.\nYet, their draglines are not the toughest.\nIn fact, the toughest dragline in this survey\nis this one right here in this white region,\na non orb-web-weaving spider.\nThis is the dragline spun by scytodes,\nthe spitting spider.\nScytodes doesn't use a web at all\nto catch prey. Instead, scytodes\nsort of lurks around and waits for prey\nto get close to it, and then immobilizes prey\nby spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.\nThink of hunting with silly string.\nThat's how scytodes forages.\nWe don't really know why scytodes\nneeds such a tough dragline,\nbut it's unexpected results like this that make\nbio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.\nIt frees us from the constraints\nof our imagination.\n\n\n\n12:14\n\n\nNow I'm going to mark on\nthe toughness values for nylon fiber,\nbombyx — or domesticated silkworm silk —\nwool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.\nAnd what you can see is that nearly\nall the spider draglines surpass them.\nIt's the combination of strength, extensibility\nand toughness that makes spider silk so\nspecial, and that has attracted the attention\nof biomimeticists, so people that turn\nto nature to try to find new solutions.\nAnd the strength, extensibility and toughness\nof spider silks combined with the fact that\nsilks do not elicit an immune response,\nhave attracted a lot of interest in the use\nof spider silks in biomedical applications,\nfor example, as a component of\nartificial tendons, for serving as\nguides to regrow nerves, and for\nscaffolds for tissue growth.\n\n\n\n13:11\n\n\nSpider silks also have a lot of potential\nfor their anti-ballistic capabilities.\nSilks could be incorporated into body\nand equipment armor that would be more\nlightweight and flexible\nthan any armor available today.\nIn addition to these biomimetic\napplications of spider silks,\npersonally, I find studying spider silks\njust fascinating in and of itself.\nI love when I'm in the laboratory,\na new spider silk sequence comes in.\nThat's just the best. (Laughter)\nIt's like the spiders are sharing\nan ancient secret with me, and that's why\nI'm going to spend the rest of my life\nstudying spider silk.\nThe next time you see a spider web,\nplease, pause and look a little closer.\nYou'll be seeing one of the most\nhigh-performance materials known to man.\nTo borrow from the writings\nof a spider named Charlotte,\nsilk is terrific.\n\n\n\n14:15\n\n\nThank you. (Applause)\n\n\n\n14:18\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nMia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter\nimportant for the US right now\nand in the world?\n\n\n\n 0:19\n\n\nPatrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter\nis our call to action.\nIt is a tool to reimagine a world\nwhere black people are free to exist,\nfree to live.\nIt is a tool for our allies\nto show up differently for us.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nI grew up in a neighborhood\nthat was heavily policed.\nI witnessed my brothers and my siblings\ncontinuously stopped and frisked\nby law enforcement.\nI remember my home being raided.\nAnd one of my questions\nas a child was, why?\nWhy us?\nBlack Lives Matter\noffers answers to the why.\nIt offers a new vision\nfor young black girls around the world\nthat we deserve to be fought for,\nthat we deserve to call\non local governments to show up for us.\n\n\n\n 1:18\n\n\nOpal Tometi: And antiblack racism —\n\n\n\n 1:20\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 1:23\n\n\nAnd antiblack racism is not only\nhappening in the United States.\nIt's actually happening\nall across the globe.\nAnd what we need now more than ever\nis a human rights movement\nthat challenges systemic racism\nin every single context.\n\n\n\n 1:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 1:43\n\n\nWe need this because the global reality\nis that black people\nare subject to all sorts of disparities\nin most of our most challenging\nissues of our day.\nI think about issues like climate change,\nand how six of the 10 worst impacted\nnations by climate change\nare actually on the continent of Africa.\nPeople are reeling\nfrom all sorts of unnatural disasters,\ndisplacing them\nfrom their ancestral homes\nand leaving them without a chance\nat making a decent living.\n\n\n\n 2:19\n\n\nWe also see disasters\nlike Hurricane Matthew,\nwhich recently wreaked havoc\nin many different nations,\nbut caused the most damage to Haiti.\nHaiti is the poorest country\nin this hemisphere,\nand its inhabitants are black people.\nAnd what we're seeing in Haiti\nis that they were actually facing\na number of challenges\nthat even preceded this hurricane.\nThey were reeling from the earthquake,\nthey were reeling from cholera\nthat was brought in by UN peacekeepers\nand still hasn't been eradicated.\nThis is unconscionable.\nAnd this would not happen if this nation\ndidn't have a population that was black,\nand we have to be real about that.\n\n\n\n 3:06\n\n\nBut what's most heartening right now\nis that despite these challenges,\nwhat we're seeing is\nthat there's a network of Africans\nall across the continent\nwho are rising up and fighting back\nand demanding climate justice.\n\n\n\n 3:19\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 3:22\n\n\nMB: So Alicia,\nyou've said that when\nblack people are free,\neveryone is free.\nCan you talk about what that means?\n\n\n\n 3:30\n\n\nAlicia Garza: Sure.\nSo I think race and racism\nis probably the most studied\nsocial, economic and political\nphenomenon in this country,\nbut it's also the least understood.\nThe reality is that race\nin the United States\noperates on a spectrum\nfrom black to white.\nDoesn't mean that people who are\nin between don't experience racism,\nbut it means that the closer\nyou are to white on that spectrum,\nthe better off you are.\nAnd the closer to black\nthat you are on that spectrum\nthe worse off your are.\nWhen we think about\nhow we address problems in this country,\nwe often start from a place\nof trickle-down justice.\nSo using white folks\nas the control we say,\nwell, if we make things\nbetter for white folks\nthen everybody else is going to get free.\nBut actually it doesn't work that way.\nWe have to address problems at the root,\nand when you deal with what's\nhappening in black communities,\nit creates an effervescence, right?\nSo a bubble up rather than a trickle down.\nLet me give an example.\nWhen we talk about the wage gap,\nwe often say women make 78 cents\nto every dollar that a man makes.\nYou all have heard that before.\nBut those are the statistics\nfor white women and white men.\nThe reality is that black women\nmake something like 64 cents\nto every 78 cents that white women make.\nWhen we talk about latinas,\nit goes down to about 58 cents.\nIf we were to talk about indigenous women,\nif we were to talk about trans women,\nit would even go further down.\nSo again,\nif you deal with those\nwho are the most impacted,\neverybody has an opportunity\nto benefit from that,\nrather than dealing with the folks\nwho are not as impacted,\nand expecting it to trickle down.\n\n\n\n 5:17\n\n\nMB: So I love the effervescence,\nbubbling up.\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nAG: Effervescence — like champagne.\n\n\n\n 5:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\nMB: Who doesn't love\na glass of champagne, right?\nChampagne and freedom, right?\n\n\n\n 5:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nWhat more could we want, y'all?\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nSo you all have been\ndoing this for a minute,\nand the last few years have been —\nwell, I can't even imagine,\nbut I'm sure very transformative.\nAnd I know that you all\nhave learned a lot about leadership.\nWhat do you want\nto share with these people\nabout what you've learned\nabout leadership?\nPatrisse, let's start with you.\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nPC: Yeah, we have to invest\nin black leadership.\nThat's what I've learned the most\nin the last few years.\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nWhat we've seen is thousands\nof black people showing up for our lives\nwith very little infrastructure\nand very little support.\nI think our work as movement leaders\nisn't just about our own visibility\nbut rather how do we\nmake the whole visible.\nHow do we not just fight\nfor our individual selves\nbut fight for everybody?\nAnd I also think\nleadership looks like\neverybody in this audience\nshowing up for black lives.\nIt's not just about coming\nand watching people on a stage, right?\nIt's about how do you\nbecome that leader —\nwhether it's in your workplace,\nwhether it's in your home —\nand believe that the movement\nfor black lives isn't just for us,\nbut it's for everybody.\n\n\n\n 6:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nMB: What about you, Opal?\n\n\n\n 6:57\n\n\nOT: So I've been learning\na great deal about interdependence.\nI've been learning\nabout how to trust your team.\nI've come up with this new mantra\nafter coming back\nfrom a three-month sabbatical,\nwhich is rare for black women to take\nwho are in leadership,\nbut I felt it was really important\nfor my leadership and for my team\nto also practice stepping back\nas well as also sometimes stepping in.\nAnd what I learned in this process\nwas that we need to acknowledge\nthat different people\ncontribute different strengths,\nand that in order\nfor our entire team to flourish,\nwe have to allow them\nto share and allow them to shine.\nAnd so during my sabbatical\nwith the organization\nthat I also work with,\nI saw our team rise up in my absence.\nThey were able to launch new programs,\nfundraise.\nAnd when I came back,\nI had to give them\na lot of gratitude and praise\nbecause they showed me\nthat they truly had my back\nand that they truly had their own backs.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\nYou know, in this process\nof my sabbatical,\nI was really reminded\nof this Southern African\nphilosophy of Ubuntu.\nI am because you are;\nyou are because I am.\nAnd I realized that my own leadership,\nand the contributions\nthat I'm able to make,\nis in large part due to the contributions\nthat they make, right?\nAnd I have to acknowledge that,\nand I have to see that,\nand so my new mantra is,\n\"Keep calm and trust the team.\"\nAnd also,\n\"Keep calm and thank the team.\"\n\n\n\n 8:39\n\n\nMB: You know, one of the things\nI feel like I've heard\nin the context of the Black Lives Matter\nmovement more than anywhere else\nis about being a leaderful movement,\nand that's such a beautiful concept,\nand I think that something\nthat women often bring\nto the conversation about leadership\nis really the collective piece.\nWhat about you, Alicia?\n\n\n\n 8:57\n\n\nAG: Yeah ...\nHow many of you heard that saying\nthat leadership is lonely?\nI think that there is an element\nwhere leadership is lonely,\nbut I also believe\nthat it doesn't have to be like that.\nAnd in order for us to get to that point,\nI think there's a few things\nthat we need to be doing.\n\n\n\n 9:15\n\n\nSo one is we have to stop\ntreating leaders like superheroes.\nWe are ordinary people\nattempting to do extraordinary things,\nand so we need to be\nsupported in that way.\n\n\n\n 9:28\n\n\nThe other thing that\nI've learned about leadership\nis that there's a difference\nbetween leadership and celebrities, right?\nAnd there's a way in which we've been\nkind of transformed into celebrities\nrather than people\nwho are trying to solve a problem.\nAnd the way that we treat\ncelebrities is very fickle, right?\nWe like them one day,\nwe don't like what they're\nwearing the next day,\nand all of a sudden we have issues, right?\nSo we need to stop deifying leaders\nso that more people\nwill step into leadership.\nLots of people are terrified\nto step into leadership\nbecause of how much scrutiny they receive\nand how brutal we are with leaders.\n\n\n\n10:09\n\n\nAnd then the last thing\nthat I've learned about leadership\nis that it's really easy to be a leader\nwhen everybody likes you.\nBut it's hard to be a leader\nwhen you have to make hard choices\nand when you have to do what's right,\neven though people\nare not going to like you for it.\nAnd so in that way,\nI think another way\nthat we can support leaders\nis to struggle with us,\nbut struggle with us politically,\nnot personally.\nWe can have disagreements\nwithout being disagreeable,\nbut it's important for us\nto sharpen each other,\nso that we all can rise.\n\n\n\n10:44\n\n\nMB: That's beautiful, thank you.\n\n\n\n10:45\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:50\n\n\nSo you all are doing work\nthat forces you to face\nsome brutal, painful realities\non a daily basis.\nWhat gives you hope\nand inspires you in that context?\n\n\n\n11:06\n\n\nPC: I am hopeful for black futures.\nAnd I say that because\nwe live in a society\nthat's so obsessed with black death.\nWe have images of our death\non the TV screen,\non our Twitter timelines,\non our Facebook timelines,\nbut what if instead\nwe imagine black life?\nWe imagine black people\nliving and thriving.\nAnd that —\nthat inspires me.\n\n\n\n11:38\n\n\nOT: What inspires me\nthese days are immigrants.\nImmigrants all over the world\nwho are doing the best that they can\nto make a living,\nto survive and also to thrive.\nRight now there are\nover 244 million people\nwho aren't living\nin their country of origin.\nThis is a 40 percent increase\nsince the year 2000.\nSo what this tells me\nis that the disparities across the globe\nare only getting worse.\nYet there are people who are finding\nthe strength and wherewithal to travel,\nto move,\nto eke out a better living for themselves\nand to provide for their families\nand their loved ones.\nAnd some of these people\nwho are immigrants\nare also undocumented.\nThey're unauthorized.\nAnd they inspire me even more\nbecause although our society\nis telling them, you're not wanted,\nyou're not needed here,\nand they're highly vulnerable\nand subject to abuse, to wage theft,\nto exploitation and xenophobic attacks,\nmany of them are also beginning\nto organize in their communities.\nAnd what I'm seeing is\nthat there's also an emerging network\nof black, undocumented people\nwho are resisting the framework,\nand resisting the criminalization\nof their existence.\nAnd that to me is incredibly powerful\nand inspires me every singe day.\n\n\n\n13:03\n\n\nMB: Thank you.\nAlicia?\n\n\n\n13:08\n\n\nAG: So we know that young people\nare the present and the future,\nbut what inspires me are older people\nwho are becoming transformed\nin the service of this movement.\nWe all know that as you get older,\nyou get a little more\nentrenched in your ways.\nIt's happening to me, I know that's right.\nBut I'm so inspired when I see people\nwho have a way that they do things,\nhave a way that they\nthink about the world,\nand they're courageous enough to be open\nto listening to what the experiences are\nof so many of us who want\nto live in world that's just\nand want to live\nin a world that's equitable.\nAnd I'm also inspired by the actions\nthat I'm seeing older people taking\nin service of this movement.\nI'm inspired by seeing older people\nstep into their own power and leadership\nand say, \"I'm not passing a torch,\nI'm helping you light the fire.\"\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n14:03\n\n\nMB: I love that —\nyes.\n\n\n\n14:06\n\n\nSo in terms of action,\nI think that it is awesome to sit here\nand be able to listen to you all,\nand to have our minds open and shift,\nbut that's not going to get\nblack people free.\nSo if you had one thing\nyou would like this audience\nand the folks who are watching\naround the world to actually do,\nwhat would that be?\n\n\n\n14:30\n\n\nAG: OK, two quick ones.\nOne, call the White House.\nThe water protectors\nare being forcibly removed\nfrom the camp that they have set up\nto defend what keeps us alive.\nAnd that is intricately\nrelated to black lives.\nSo definitely call the White House\nand demand that they stop doing that.\nThere are tanks\nand police officers arresting\nevery single person there as we speak.\n\n\n\n14:59\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:01\n\n\nThe second thing that you can do\nis to join something.\nBe a part of something.\nThere are groups, collectives —\ndoesn't have to be a non-profit,\nyou know what I mean?\nBut there are groups that are doing\nwork in our communities right now\nto make sure that black lives matter\nso all lives matter.\nGet involved;\ndon't sit on your couch and tell people\nwhat you think they should be doing.\nGo do it with us.\n\n\n\n15:30\n\n\nMB: Do you guys want to add anything?\nThat's good? All right. So —\nAnd I think that the joining something,\nlike if you feel like there's\nnot something where you are, start it.\n\n\n\n15:40\n\n\nAG: Start it.\n\n\n\n15:41\n\n\nMB: These conversations that we're having,\nhave those conversations\nwith somebody else.\nAnd then instead of just\nletting it be a talk that you had,\nactually decide to start something.\n\n\n\n15:50\n\n\nOT: That's right.\n\n\n\n15:51\n\n\nMB: I mean, that's what you all did.\nYou started something,\nand look what's happened.\nThank you all so much\nfor being here with us today.\n\n\n\n15:58\n\n\nOT: Thank you.\n\n\n\n16:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nAs a boy in Lima,\nmy grandfather told me a legend\nof the Spanish conquest of Peru.\nAtahualpa, emperor of the Inca,\nhad been captured and killed.\nPizarro and his conquistadors\nhad grown rich,\nand tales of their conquest\nand glory had reached Spain\nand was bringing new waves of Spaniards,\nhungry for gold and glory.\nThey would go into towns and ask the Inca,\n\"Where's another civilization\nwe can conquer? Where's more gold?\"\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\nAnd the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,\n\"Go to the Amazon.\nYou'll find all the gold you want there.\nIn fact, there is a city called Paititi —\nEl Dorado in Spanish —\nmade entirely of gold.\"\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\nThe Spanish set off into the jungle,\nbut the few that return\ncome back with stories,\nstories of powerful shamans,\nof warriors with poisoned arrows,\nof trees so tall they blotted out the sun,\nspiders that ate birds,\nsnakes that swallowed men whole\nand a river that boiled.\n\n\n\n 1:24\n\n\nAll this became a childhood memory.\nAnd years passed.\nI'm working on my PhD at SMU,\ntrying to understand\nPeru's geothermal energy potential,\nwhen I remember this legend,\nand I began asking that question.\nCould the boiling river exist?\n\n\n\n 1:43\n\n\nI asked colleagues from universities,\nthe government,\noil, gas and mining companies,\nand the answer was a unanimous no.\nAnd this makes sense.\nYou see, boiling rivers\ndo exist in the world,\nbut they're generally\nassociated with volcanoes.\nYou need a powerful heat source\nto produce such a large\ngeothermal manifestation.\nAnd as you can see from the red dots\nhere, which are volcanoes,\nwe don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,\nnor in most of Peru.\nSo it follows: We should not expect\nto see a boiling river.\n\n\n\n 2:20\n\n\nTelling this same story\nat a family dinner,\nmy aunt tells me,\n\"But no, Andrés, I've been there.\nI've swum in that river.\"\n\n\n\n 2:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nThen my uncle jumps in.\n\"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.\nYou see, you can only swim in it\nafter a very heavy rain,\nand it's protected by a powerful shaman.\nYour aunt, she's friends with his wife.\"\n\n\n\n 2:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:52\n\n\n\"¿Cómo?\" [\"Huh?\"]\n\n\n\n 2:53\n\n\nYou know, despite all\nmy scientific skepticism,\nI found myself hiking into the jungle,\nguided by my aunt,\nover 700 kilometers away\nfrom the nearest volcanic center,\nand well, honestly,\nmentally preparing myself\nto behold the legendary\n\"warm stream of the Amazon.\"\n\n\n\n 3:13\n\n\nBut then ...\nI heard something,\na low surge\nthat got louder and louder\nas we came closer.\nIt sounded like ocean waves\nconstantly crashing,\nand as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,\ncoming up through the trees.\nAnd then, I saw this.\n\n\n\n 3:40\n\n\nI immediately grabbed for my thermometer,\nand the average temperatures in the river\nwere 86 degrees C.\nThis is not quite\nthe 100-degree C boiling\nbut definitely close enough.\nThe river flowed hot and fast.\nI followed it upriver and was led by,\nactually, the shaman's apprentice\nto the most sacred site on the river.\nAnd this is what's bizarre —\nIt starts off as a cold stream.\nAnd here, at this site,\nis the home of the Yacumama,\nmother of the waters,\na giant serpent spirit\nwho births hot and cold water.\nAnd here we find a hot spring,\nmixing with cold stream water\nunderneath her protective motherly jaws\nand thus bringing their legends to life.\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\nThe next morning, I woke up and —\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:39\n\n\nI asked for tea.\nI was handed a mug, a tea bag\nand, well, pointed towards the river.\nTo my surprise, the water was clean\nand had a pleasant taste,\nwhich is a little weird\nfor geothermal systems.\n\n\n\n 4:55\n\n\nWhat was amazing\nis that the locals had always\nknown about this place,\nand that I was by no means\nthe first outsider to see it.\nIt was just part of their everyday life.\nThey drink its water.\nThey take in its vapor.\nThey cook with it,\nclean with it,\neven make their medicines with it.\n\n\n\n 5:20\n\n\nI met the shaman,\nand he seemed like an extension\nof the river and his jungle.\nHe asked for my intentions\nand listened carefully.\nThen, to my tremendous relief —\nI was freaking out,\nto be honest with you —\na smile began to snake across his face,\nand he just laughed.\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\nI had received the shaman's blessing\nto study the river,\non the condition that after I take\nthe water samples\nand analyze them in my lab,\nwherever I was in the world,\nthat I pour the waters\nback into the ground\nso that, as the shaman said,\nthe waters could find their way back home.\n\n\n\n 6:10\n\n\nI've been back every year\nsince that first visit in 2011,\nand the fieldwork has been exhilarating,\ndemanding and at times dangerous.\nOne story was even featured\nin National Geographic Magazine.\nI was trapped on a small rock\nabout the size of a sheet of paper\nin sandals and board shorts,\nin between an 80 degree C river\nand a hot spring that, well,\nlooked like this, close to boiling.\nAnd on top of that,\nit was Amazon rain forest.\nPshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.\nThe temperature differential\nmade it all white. It was a whiteout.\nIntense.\n\n\n\n 6:53\n\n\nNow, after years of work,\nI'll soon be submitting my geophysical\nand geochemical studies for publication.\nAnd I'd like to share, today,\nwith all of you here, on the TED stage,\nfor the first time,\nsome of these discoveries.\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nWell, first off, it's not a legend.\nSurprise!\n\n\n\n 7:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:17\n\n\nWhen I first started the research,\nthe satellite imagery was too\nlow-resolution to be meaningful.\nThere were just no good maps.\nThanks to the support\nof the Google Earth team,\nI now have this.\nNot only that, the indigenous name\nof the river, Shanay-timpishka,\n\"boiled with the heat of the sun,\"\nindicating that I'm not the first\nto wonder why the river boils,\nand showing that humanity\nhas always sought to explain\nthe world around us.\n\n\n\n 7:52\n\n\nSo why does the river boil?\n\n\n\n 7:54\n\n\n(Bubbling sounds)\n\n\n\n 7:59\n\n\nIt actually took me three years\nto get that footage.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\nFault-fed hot springs.\nAs we have hot blood running\nthrough our veins and arteries,\nso, too, the earth has hot water\nrunning through its cracks and faults.\nWhere these arteries come to the surface,\nthese earth arteries,\nwe'll get geothermal manifestations:\nfumaroles, hot springs\nand in our case, the boiling river.\n\n\n\n 8:27\n\n\nWhat's truly incredible, though,\nis the scale of this place.\nNext time you cross the road,\nthink about this.\nThe river flows wider than a two-lane road\nalong most of its path.\nIt flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.\nTruly impressive.\nThere are thermal pools\nlarger than this TED stage,\nand that waterfall that you see there\nis six meters tall —\nand all with near-boiling water.\n\n\n\n 9:03\n\n\nWe mapped the temperatures\nalong the river,\nand this was by far the most\ndemanding part of the fieldwork.\nAnd the results were just awesome.\nSorry — the geoscientist\nin me coming out.\nAnd it showed this amazing trend.\nYou see, the river starts off cold.\nIt then heats up, cools back down,\nheats up, cools back down,\nheats up again, and then has\nthis beautiful decay curve\nuntil it smashes into this cold river.\n\n\n\n 9:29\n\n\nNow, I understand not all of you\nare geothermal scientists,\nso to put it in more everyday terms:\nEveryone loves coffee.\nYes? Good.\nYour regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,\nan extra-hot one, well, 60.\nSo, put in coffee shop terms,\nthe boiling river plots like this.\nThere you have your hot coffee.\nHere you have your extra-hot coffee,\nand you can see\nthat there's a bit point there\nwhere the river is still hotter\nthan even the extra-hot coffee.\nAnd these are average water temperatures.\nWe took these in the dry season to ensure\nthe purest geothermal temperatures.\n\n\n\n10:07\n\n\nBut there's a magic number here\nthat's not being shown,\nand that number is 47 degrees C,\nbecause that's where things start to hurt,\nand I know this from very\npersonal experience.\nAbove that temperature,\nyou don't want to get in that water.\nYou need to be careful.\nIt can be deadly.\n\n\n\n10:27\n\n\nI've seen all sorts of animals fall in,\nand what's shocking to me,\nis the process is pretty much the same.\nSo they fall in and the first thing\nto go are the eyes.\nEyes, apparently, cook very quickly.\nThey turn this milky-white color.\nThe stream is carrying them.\nThey're trying to swim out,\nbut their meat is cooking on the bone\nbecause it's so hot.\nSo they're losing power, losing power,\nuntil finally they get to a point\nwhere hot water goes into their mouths\nand they cook from the inside out.\n\n\n\n10:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:59\n\n\nA bit sadistic, aren't we?\nJeez.\nLeave them marinating for a little longer.\nWhat's, again, amazing\nare these temperatures.\nThey're similar to things that I've seen\non volcanoes all over the world\nand even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.\n\n\n\n11:17\n\n\nBut here's the thing:\nthe data is showing\nthat the boiling river exists\nindependent of volcanism.\nIt's neither magmatic\nor volcanic in origin,\nand again, over 700 kilometers away\nfrom the nearest volcanic center.\n\n\n\n11:41\n\n\nHow can a boiling river exist like this?\nI've asked geothermal experts\nand volcanologists for years,\nand I'm still unable to find another\nnon-volcanic geothermal system\nof this magnitude.\nIt's unique.\nIt's special on a global scale.\nSo, still — how does it work?\nWhere do we get this heat?\nThere's still more research to be done\nto better constrain the problem\nand better understand the system,\nbut from what the data is telling us now,\nit looks to be the result\nof a large hydrothermal system.\n\n\n\n12:24\n\n\nBasically, it works like this:\nSo, the deeper you go\ninto the earth, the hotter it gets.\nWe refer to this\nas the geothermal gradient.\nThe waters could be coming\nfrom as far away as glaciers in the Andes,\nthen seeping down deep into the earth\nand coming out to form the boiling river\nafter getting heated up\nfrom the geothermal gradient,\nall due to this unique geologic setting.\n\n\n\n12:49\n\n\nNow, we found\nthat in and around the river —\nthis is working with colleagues\nfrom National Geographic,\nDr. Spencer Wells,\nand Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis —\nwe genetically sequenced\nthe extremophile lifeforms\nliving in and around the river,\nand have found new lifeforms,\nunique species living\nin the boiling river.\n\n\n\n13:11\n\n\nBut again, despite all of these studies,\nall of these discoveries and the legends,\na question remains:\nWhat is the significance\nof the boiling river?\nWhat is the significance\nof this stationary cloud\nthat always hovers\nover this patch of jungle?\nAnd what is the significance\nof a detail in a childhood legend?\n\n\n\n13:42\n\n\nTo the shaman and his community,\nit's a sacred site.\nTo me, as a geoscientist,\nit's a unique geothermal phenomenon.\nBut to the illegal loggers\nand cattle farmers,\nit's just another resource to exploit.\nAnd to the Peruvian government,\nit's just another stretch\nof unprotected land ready for development.\n\n\n\n14:13\n\n\nMy goal is to ensure\nthat whoever controls this land\nunderstands the boiling river's\nuniqueness and significance.\nBecause that's the question,\none of significance.\nAnd the thing there is,\nwe define significance.\nIt's us. We have that power.\nWe are the ones who draw that line\nbetween the sacred and the trivial.\nAnd in this age,\nwhere everything seems mapped,\nmeasured and studied,\nin this age of information,\nI remind you all that discoveries\nare not just made\nin the black void of the unknown\nbut in the white noise\nof overwhelming data.\n\n\n\n15:08\n\n\nThere remains so much to explore.\nWe live in an incredible world.\nSo go out.\nBe curious.\nBecause we do live in a world\nwhere shamans still sing\nto the spirits of the jungle,\nwhere rivers do boil\nand where legends do come to life.\n\n\n\n15:38\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n15:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nChris Anderson: Welcome\nto this next edition of TED Dialogues.\nWe're trying to do\nsome bridging here today.\nYou know, the American dream\nhas inspired millions of people\naround the world for many years.\nToday, I think, you can say\nthat America is divided,\nperhaps more than ever,\nand the divisions seem\nto be getting worse.\nIt's actually really hard\nfor people on different sides\nto even have a conversation.\nPeople almost feel...\ndisgusted with each other.\nSome families can't even speak\nto each other right now.\nOur purpose in this dialogue today\nis to try to do something about that,\nto try to have a different kind\nof conversation,\nto do some listening, some thinking,\nsome understanding.\nAnd I have two people with us\nto help us do that.\n\n\n\n 1:05\n\n\nThey're not going to come at this\nhammer and tong against each other.\nThis is not like cable news.\nThis is two people who have both spent\na lot of their working life\nin the political center\nor right of the center.\nThey've immersed themselves\nin conservative worldviews, if you like.\nThey know that space very well.\nAnd we're going to explore together\nhow to think about\nwhat is happening right now,\nand whether we can find new ways to bridge\nand just to have wiser,\nmore connected conversations.\n\n\n\n 1:35\n\n\nWith me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,\nwho has spent a decade\nworking at Fox News,\nhosting \"Fox and Friends\"\nand then \"The Real Story,\"\nbefore taking a courageous stance\nin filing sexual harassment claims\nagainst Roger Ailes,\nwhich eventually led\nto his departure from Fox News.\nDavid Brooks, who has earned the wrath\nof many of [The New York Times's]\nleft-leaning readers\nbecause of his conservative views,\nand more recently, perhaps,\nsome of the right-leaning readers\nbecause of his criticism\nof some aspects of Trump.\nYet, his columns are usually\nthe top one, two or three\nmost-read content of the day\nbecause they're brilliant,\nbecause they bring psychology\nand social science\nto providing understanding\nfor what's going on.\nSo without further ado, a huge welcome\nto Gretchen and David.\nCome and join me.\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:37\n\n\nSo, Gretchen.\nSixty-three million Americans\nvoted for Donald Trump.\nWhy did they do this?\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nGretchen Carlson: There are a lot\nof reasons, in my mind, why it happened.\nI mean, I think it was a movement\nof sorts, but it started long ago.\nIt didn't just happen overnight.\n\"Anger\" would be the first word\nthat I would think of —\nanger with nothing\nbeing done in Washington,\nanger about not being heard.\nI think there was a huge swath\nof the population\nthat feels like Washington\nnever listens to them,\nyou know, a good part of the middle\nof America, not just the coasts,\nand he was somebody they felt\nwas listening to their concerns.\nSo I think those two issues\nwould be the main reason.\nI have to throw in there also celebrity.\nI think that had a huge impact\non Donald Trump becoming president.\n\n\n\n 3:34\n\n\nCA: Was the anger justified?\n\n\n\n 3:37\n\n\nDavid Brooks: Yeah, I think so.\nIn 2015 and early 2016,\nI wrote about 30 columns\nwith the following theme:\ndon't worry, Donald Trump will never\nbe the Republican nominee.\n\n\n\n 3:47\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\nAnd having done that\nand gotten that so wrong,\nI decided to spend the ensuing year\njust out in Trumpworld,\nand I found a lot of economic dislocation.\nI ran into a woman in West Virginia\nwho was going to a funeral for her mom.\nShe said, \"The nice thing about\nbeing Catholic is we don't have to speak,\nand that's good,\nbecause we're not word people.\"\nThat phrase rung in my head: word people.\nA lot of us in the TED community\nare word people,\nbut if you're not, the economy\nhas not been angled toward you,\nand so 11 million men, for example,\nare out of the labor force\nbecause those jobs are done away.\nA lot of social injury.\nYou used to be able to say,\n\"I'm not the richest person in the world,\nI'm not the most famous,\nbut my neighbors can count on me\nand I get some dignity out of that.\"\nAnd because of celebritification\nor whatever, if you're not rich or famous,\nyou feel invisible.\nAnd a lot of moral injury,\nsense of feeling betrayed,\nand frankly, in this country,\nwe almost have one success story,\nwhich is you go to college, get\na white-collar job, and you're a success,\nand if you don't fit in that formula,\nyou feel like you're not respected.\nAnd so that accumulation of things —\nand when I talked to Trump\nvoters and still do,\nI found most of them completely\nrealistic about his failings,\nbut they said, this is my shot.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\nGC: And yet I predicted\nthat he would be the nominee,\nbecause I've known him for 27 years.\nHe's a master marketer,\nand one of the things\nhe did extremely well\nthat President Obama also did\nextremely well,\nwas simplifying the message,\nsimplifying down to phrases\nand to a populist message.\nEven if he can't achieve it,\nit sounded good.\nAnd many people latched on\nto that simplicity again.\nIt's something they could grasp onto:\n\"I get that. I want that.\nThat sounds fantastic.\"\nAnd I remember when he used to come\non my show originally,\nbefore \"The Apprentice\"\nwas even \"The Apprentice,\"\nand he'd say it was the number\none show on TV.\nI'd say back to him, \"No, it's not.\"\nAnd he would say, \"Yes it is, Gretchen.\"\nAnd I would say, \"No it's not.\"\nBut people at home would see that,\nand they'd be like,\n\"Wow, I should be watching\nthe number one show on TV.\"\nAnd — lo and behold — it became\nthe number one show on TV.\nSo he had this, I've seen\nthis ability in him\nto be the master marketer.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nCA: It's puzzling\nto a lot of people on the left\nthat so many women voted for him,\ndespite some of his comments.\n\n\n\n 6:04\n\n\nGC: I wrote a column\nabout this for Time Motto,\nsaying that I really believe\nthat lot of people put on blinders,\nand maybe for the first time,\nsome people decided\nthat policies they believed in\nand being heard\nand not being invisible anymore\nwas more important to them\nthan the way in which he had acted\nor acts as a human.\nAnd so human dignity —\nwhether it would be the dust-up\nabout the disabled reporter,\nor what happened\nin that audiotape with Billy Bush\nand the way in which he spoke\nabout women —\nthey put that aside\nand pretended as if\nthey hadn't seen that or heard that,\nbecause to them,\npolicies were more important.\n\n\n\n 6:46\n\n\nCA: Right, so just because\nsomeone voted for Trump,\nit's not blind adherence to everything\nthat he's said or stood for.\n\n\n\n 6:53\n\n\nGC: No. I heard a lot of people\nthat would say to me,\n\"Wow, I just wish he would shut up\nbefore the election.\nIf he would just stay quiet,\nhe'd get elected.\"\n\n\n\n 7:03\n\n\nCA: And so, maybe for people on the left\nthere's a trap there,\nto sort of despise\nor just be baffled by the support,\nassuming that it's for some\nof the unattractive features.\nActually, maybe they're supporting\nhim despite those,\nbecause they see something exciting.\nThey see a man of action.\nThey see the choking hold of government\nbeing thrown off in some way\nand they're excited by that.\n\n\n\n 7:26\n\n\nGC: But don't forget we saw that\non the left as well — Bernie Sanders.\nSo this is one of the commonalities\nthat I think we can talk about today,\n\"The Year of the Outsider,\"\nDavid — right?\nAnd even though Bernie Sanders\nhas been in Congress for a long time,\nhe was deemed an outsider this time.\nAnd so there was anger\non the left as well,\nand so many people were in favor\nof Bernie Sanders.\nSo I see it as a commonality.\nPeople who like Trump,\npeople who like Bernie Sanders,\nthey were liking different policies,\nbut the underpinning was anger.\n\n\n\n 8:00\n\n\nCA: David, there's often\nthis narrative, then,\nthat the sole explanation\nfor Trump's victory and his rise\nis his tapping into anger\nin a very visceral way.\nBut you've written a bit about\nthat it's actually more than that,\nthat there's a worldview\nthat's being worked on here.\nCould you talk about that?\n\n\n\n 8:24\n\n\nDB: I would say he understood what,\nfrankly, I didn't,\nwhich is what debate we were having.\nAnd so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,\nand it was the big government\nversus small government debate.\nIt was Barry Goldwater\nversus George McGovern,\nand that was the debate\nwe had been having for a generation.\nIt was: Democrats wanted to use\ngovernment to enhance equality,\nRepublicans wanted to limit government\nto enhance freedom.\nThat was the debate.\nHe understood what I think\nthe two major parties did not,\nwhich was that's not the debate anymore.\nThe debate is now open versus closed.\nOn one side are those who have\nthe tailwinds of globalization\nand the meritocracy blowing at their back,\nand they tend to favor open trade,\nopen borders, open social mores,\nbecause there are so many opportunities.\nOn the other side are those\nwho feel the headwinds of globalization\nand the meritocracy\njust blasting in their faces,\nand they favor closed trade,\nclosed borders, closed social mores,\nbecause they just want some security.\nAnd so he was right\non that fundamental issue,\nand people were willing\nto overlook a lot to get there.\nAnd so he felt that sense of security.\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\nWe're speaking the morning after\nTrump's joint session speech.\nThere are three traditional\ngroups in the Republican Party.\nThere are the foreign policies hawks\nwho believe in America\nas global policeman.\nTrump totally repudiated that view.\nSecond, there was the social conservatives\nwho believed in religious liberty,\npro-life,\nprayer in schools.\nHe totally ignored that.\nThere was not a single mention\nof a single social conservative issue.\nAnd then there were the fiscal hawks,\nthe people who wanted to cut down\non the national debt, Tea Party,\ncut the size of government.\nHe's expanding the size of government!\nHere's a man who has single-handedly\nrevolutionized a major American party\nbecause he understood\nwhere the debate was headed\nbefore other people.\nAnd then guys like Steve Bannon come in\nand give him substance to his impulses.\n\n\n\n10:15\n\n\nCA: And so take that a bit further,\nand maybe expand a bit more\non your insights\ninto Steve Bannon's worldview.\nBecause he's sometimes tarred\nin very simple terms\nas this dangerous, racist,\nxenophobic, anger-sparking person.\nThere's more to the story;\nthat is perhaps an unfair simplification.\n\n\n\n10:36\n\n\nDB: I think that part is true,\nbut there's another part\nthat's probably true, too.\nHe's part of a global movement.\nIt's like being around Marxists in 1917.\nThere's him here, there's the UKIP party,\nthere's the National Front in France,\nthere's Putin, there's a Turkish version,\na Philippine version.\nSo we have to recognize that this\nis a global intellectual movement.\nAnd it believes\nthat wisdom and virtue is not held\nin individual conversation and civility\nthe way a lot of us\nin the enlightenment side of the world do.\nIt's held in — the German word\nis the \"volk\" — in the people,\nin the common, instinctive wisdom\nof the plain people.\nAnd the essential virtue of that people\nis always being threatened by outsiders.\nAnd he's got a strategy\nfor how to get there.\nHe's got a series of policies\nto bring the people up\nand repudiate the outsiders,\nwhether those outsiders\nare Islam, Mexicans, the media,\nthe coastal elites...\nAnd there's a whole worldview there;\nit's a very coherent worldview.\nI sort of have more respect for him.\nI loathe what he stands for\nand I think he's wrong on the substance,\nbut it's interesting to see someone\nwith a set of ideas\nfind a vehicle, Donald Trump,\nand then try to take control\nof the White House\nin order to advance his viewpoint.\n\n\n\n11:53\n\n\nCA: So it's almost become, like,\nthat the core question of our time now is:\nCan you be patriotic\nbut also have a global mindset?\nAre these two things\nimplacably opposed to each other?\nI mean, a lot of conservatives\nand, to the extent\nthat it's a different category,\na lot of Trump supporters,\nare infuriated by the coastal elites\nand the globalists\nbecause they see them\nas, sort of, not cheering for America,\nnot embracing fully American values.\nI mean, have you seen that\nin your conversations with people,\nin your understanding of their mindset?\n\n\n\n12:30\n\n\nGC: I do think that there's\na huge difference between —\nI hate to put people in categories, but,\nMiddle America versus\npeople who live on the coasts.\nIt's an entirely different existence.\nAnd I grew up in Minnesota, so I have\nan understanding of Middle America,\nand I've never forgotten it.\nAnd maybe that's why I have\nan understanding of what happened here,\nbecause those people often feel\nlike nobody's listening to them,\nand that we're only concentrating\non California and New York.\nAnd so I think that was a huge reason\nwhy Trump was elected.\nI mean, these people felt like\nthey were being heard.\nWhether or not patriotism falls into that,\nI'm not sure about that.\nI do know one thing:\na lot of things Trump talked about\nlast night are not conservative things.\nHad Hillary Clinton gotten up\nand given that speech,\nnot one Republican would have\nstood up to applaud.\nI mean, he's talking about spending\na trillion dollars on infrastructure.\nThat is not a conservative viewpoint.\nHe talked about government-mandated\nmaternity leave.\nA lot of women may love that;\nit's not a conservative viewpoint.\nSo it's fascinating\nthat people who loved what his message\nwas during the campaign,\nI'm not sure — how do you\nthink they'll react to that?\n\n\n\n13:43\n\n\nDB: I should say I grew up\nin Lower Manhattan,\nin the triangle between ABC Carpets,\nthe Strand Bookstore\nand The Odeon restaurant.\n\n\n\n13:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:51\n\n\nGC: Come to Minnesota sometime!\n\n\n\n13:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:54\n\n\nCA: You are a card-carrying member\nof the coastal elite, my man.\nBut what did you make\nof the speech last night?\nIt seemed to be a move\nto a more moderate position,\non the face of it.\n\n\n\n14:07\n\n\nDB: Yeah, I thought it\nwas his best speech,\nand it took away the freakishness of him.\nI do think he's a moral freak,\nand I think he'll be undone by that fact,\nthe fact that he just doesn't know\nanything about anything\nand is uncurious about it.\n\n\n\n14:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:21\n\n\nBut if you take away these minor flaws,\nI think we got to see him at his best,\nand it was revealing for me\nto see him at his best,\nbecause to me, it exposed a central\ncontradiction that he's got to confront,\nthat a lot of what he's doing\nis offering security.\nSo, \"I'm ordering closed borders,\nI'm going to secure the world\nfor you, for my people.\"\nBut then if you actually look\nat a lot of his economic policies,\nlike health care reform, which is about\nprivate health care accounts,\nthat's not security, that's risk.\nEducational vouchers: that's risk.\nDeregulation: that's risk.\nThere's really a contradiction\nbetween the security of the mindset\nand a lot of the policies,\nwhich are very risk-oriented.\nAnd what I would say, especially\nhaving spent this year,\nthe people in rural Minnesota,\nin New Mexico —\nthey've got enough risk in their lives.\nAnd so they're going to say,\n\"No thank you.\"\nAnd I think his health care repeal\nwill fail for that reason.\n\n\n\n15:18\n\n\nCA: But despite the criticisms\nyou just made of him,\nit does at least seem that he's listening\nto a surprisingly wide range of voices;\nit's not like everyone\nis coming from the same place.\nAnd maybe that leads to a certain\namount of chaos and confusion, but —\n\n\n\n15:35\n\n\nGC: I actually don't think he's listening\nto a wide range of voices.\nI think he's listening to very few people.\nThat's just my impression of it.\nI believe that some of the things\nhe said last night\nhad Ivanka all over them.\nSo I believe he was listening\nto her before that speech.\nAnd he was Teleprompter Trump\nlast night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.\nAnd that's why, before we came out here,\nI said, \"We better check Twitter\nto see if anything's changed.\"\nAnd also I think you have to keep in mind\nthat because he's such a unique character,\nwhat was the bar that we\nwere expecting last night?\nWas it here or here or here?\nAnd so he comes out\nand gives a looking political speech,\nand everyone goes, \"Wow! He can do it.\"\nIt just depends\non which direction he goes.\n\n\n\n16:22\n\n\nDB: Yeah, and we're trying\nto build bridges here,\nand especially for an audience\nthat may have contempt for Trump,\nit's important to say,\nno, this is a real thing.\nBut as I try my best to go an hour\nshowing respect for him,\nmy thyroid is surging,\nbecause I think the oddities\nof his character\nreally are condemnatory\nand are going to doom him.\n\n\n\n16:41\n\n\nCA: Your reputation is as a conservative.\nPeople would you describe you\nas right of center,\nand yet here you are\nwith this visceral reaction against him\nand some of what he stands for.\nI mean, I'm — how do you have\na conversation?\nThe people who support him,\non evidence so far,\nare probably pretty excited.\nHe's certainly shown real engagement\nin a lot of what he promised to do,\nand there is a strong desire\nto change the system radically.\nPeople hate what government has become\nand how it's left them out.\n\n\n\n17:20\n\n\nGC: I totally agree with that,\nbut I think that when he was proposing\na huge government program last night\nthat we used to call the bad s-word,\n\"stimulus,\" I find it completely ironic.\nTo spend a trillion dollars\non something —\nthat is not a conservative viewpoint.\nThen again, I don't really believe\nhe's a Republican.\n\n\n\n17:35\n\n\nDB: And I would say, as someone\nwho identifies as conservative:\nfirst of all,\nto be conservative is to believe\nin the limitations of politics.\nSamuel Johnson said, \"Of all the things\nthat human hearts endure,\nhow few are those that kings\ncan cause and cure.\"\nPolitics is a limited realm;\nwhat matters most\nis the moral nature of the society.\nAnd so I have to think\ncharacter comes first,\nand a man who doesn't pass\nthe character threshold\ncannot be a good president.\nSecond, I'm the kind\nof conservative who —\nI harken back to Alexander Hamilton,\nwho was a Latino hip-hop star\nfrom the heights —\n\n\n\n18:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n18:11\n\n\nbut his definition of America\nwas very future-oriented.\nHe was a poor boy from the islands\nwho had this rapid and amazing\nrise to success,\nand he wanted government to give\npoor boys and girls like him\na chance to succeed,\nusing limited but energetic government\nto create social mobility.\nFor him and for Lincoln\nand for Teddy Roosevelt,\nthe idea of America\nwas the idea of the future.\nWe may have division and racism\nand slavery in our past,\nbut we have a common future.\nThe definition of America that Steve\nBannon stands for is backwards-looking.\nIt's nostalgic; it's for the past.\nAnd that is not traditionally\nthe American identity.\nThat's traditionally, frankly,\nthe Russian identity.\nThat's how they define virtue.\nAnd so I think it is a fundamental\nand foundational betrayal\nof what conservatism used to stand for.\n\n\n\n18:59\n\n\nCA: Well, I'd like actually\nlike to hear from you,\nand if we see some comments coming in\nfrom some of you, we'll —\noh, well here's one right now.\nJeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried\nto convince progressive friends\nthat they need to understand\nwhat motivates Trump supporters,\nyet many of them have given up\ntrying to understand\nin the face of what they perceive\nas lies, selfishness and hatred.\nHow would you reach out to such people,\nthe Tea Party of the left,\nto try to bridge this divide?\n\n\n\n19:24\n\n\nGC: I actually think\nthere are commonalities in anger,\nas I expressed earlier.\nSo I think you can come to the table,\nboth being passionate about something.\nSo at least you care.\nAnd I would like to believe —\nthe c-word has also become\na horrible word — \"compromise,\" right?\nSo you have the far left\nand the far right,\nand compromise — forget it.\nThose groups don't want\nto even think about it.\nBut you have a huge swath\nof voters, myself included,\nwho are registered independents,\nlike 40 percent of us, right?\nSo there is a huge faction of America\nthat wants to see change\nand wants to see people come together.\nIt's just that we have to figure out\nhow to do that.\n\n\n\n20:04\n\n\nCA: So let's talk about that for a minute,\nbecause we're having these TED Dialogues,\nwe're trying to bridge.\nThere's a lot of people out there,\nright now, perhaps especially on the left,\nwho think this is a terrible idea,\nthat actually, the only moral response\nto the great tyranny\nthat may be about to emerge in America\nis to resist it at every stage,\nis to fight it tooth and nail,\nit's a mistake to try and do this.\nJust fight!\nIs there a case for that?\n\n\n\n20:35\n\n\nDB: It depends what \"fight\" means.\nIf it means literal fighting, then no.\nIf it means marching, well maybe\nmarching to raise consciousness,\nthat seems fine.\nBut if you want change in this country,\nwe do it through parties and politics.\nWe organize parties, and those parties\nare big, diverse, messy coalitions,\nand we engage in politics,\nand politics is always\nmorally unsatisfying\nbecause it's always\na bunch of compromises.\nBut politics is essentially\na competition between partial truths.\nThe Trump people have a piece\nof the truth in America.\nI think Trump himself is the wrong answer\nto the right question,\nbut they have some truth,\nand it's truth found in the epidemic\nof opiates around the country,\nit's truth found in\nthe spread of loneliness,\nit's the truth found in people\nwhose lives are inverted.\nThey peaked professionally at age 30,\nand it's all been downhill since.\nAnd so, understanding that\ndoesn't take fighting,\nit takes conversation and then asking,\n\"What are we going to replace Trump with?\"\n\n\n\n21:31\n\n\nGC: But you saw fighting last night,\neven at the speech,\nbecause you saw the Democratic women\nwho came and wore white\nto honor the suffragette movement.\nI remember back during the campaign\nwhere some Trump supporters wanted\nto actually get rid of the amendment\nthat allowed us to vote as women.\nIt was like, what?\nSo I don't know if\nthat's the right way to fight.\nIt was interesting,\nbecause I was looking in the audience,\ntrying to see Democratic women\nwho didn't wear white.\nSo there's a lot going on there,\nand there's a lot of ways to fight\nthat are not necessarily doing that.\n\n\n\n22:04\n\n\nCA: I mean, one of the key\nquestions, to me, is:\nThe people who voted for Trump\nbut, if you like, are more in the center,\nlike they're possibly\namenable to persuasion —\nare they more likely to be persuaded\nby seeing a passionate uprising\nof people saying, \"No, no, no, you can't!\"\nor will that actually piss them off\nand push them away?\n\n\n\n22:29\n\n\nDB: How are any of us persuaded?\nAm I going to persuade you by saying,\n\"Well, you're kind of a bigot,\nyou're supporting bigotry,\nyou're supporting sexism.\nYou're a primitive, fascistic rise\nfrom some authoritarian past\"?\nThat's probably not going to be\ntoo persuasive to you.\nAnd so the way any of us\nare persuaded is by:\na) some basic show of respect\nfor the point of view, and saying,\n\"I think this guy is not going\nto get you where you need to go.\"\nAnd there are two phrases\nyou've heard over and over again,\nwherever you go in the country.\nOne, the phrase \"flyover country.\"\nAnd that's been heard for years,\nbut I would say this year,\nI heard it almost on an hourly basis,\na sense of feeling invisible.\nAnd then the sense a sense of the phrase\n\"political correctness.\"\nJust that rebellion: \"They're not even\nletting us say what we think.\"\nAnd I teach at Yale.\nThe narrowing of debate is real.\n\n\n\n23:23\n\n\nCA: So you would say this is a trap\nthat liberals have fallen into\nby celebrating causes\nthey really believe in,\noften expressed through the language\nof \"political correctness.\"\nThey have done damage.\nThey have pushed people away.\n\n\n\n23:38\n\n\nDB: I would say\na lot of the argument, though,\nwith \"descent to fascism,\"\n\"authoritarianism\" —\nthat just feels over-the-top to people.\nAnd listen, I've written\neight million anti-Trump columns,\nbut it is a problem, especially\nfor the coastal media,\nthat every time he does something\nslightly wrong, we go to 11,\nand we're at 11 every day.\nAnd it just strains\ncredibility at some point.\n\n\n\n23:59\n\n\nCA: Crying wolf a little too loud\nand a little too early.\nBut there may be a time\nwhen we really do have to cry wolf.\n\n\n\n24:05\n\n\nGC: But see — one of the most\nimportant things to me\nis how the conservative media\nhandles Trump.\nWill they call him out\nwhen things are not true,\nor will they just go along with it?\nTo me, that is what is essential\nin this entire discussion,\nbecause when you have\nfollowers of somebody\nwho don't really care\nif he tells the truth or not,\nthat can be very dangerous.\nSo to me, it's: How is the conservative\nmedia going to respond to it?\nI mean, you've been calling them out.\nBut how will other forms\nof conservative media deal with that\nas we move forward?\n\n\n\n24:45\n\n\nDB: It's all shifted, though.\nThe conservative media used to be Fox\nor Charles Krauthammer or George Will.\nThey're no longer the conservative media.\nNow there's another whole set\nof institutions further right,\nwhich is Breitbart and Infowars,\nAlex Jones, Laura Ingraham,\nand so they're the ones who are now\nhis base, not even so much Fox.\n\n\n\n25:04\n\n\nCA: My last question for the time being\nis just on this question of the truth.\nI mean, it's one of the scariest\nthings to people right now,\nthat there is no agreement,\nnationally, on what is true.\nI've never seen anything like it,\nwhere facts are so massively disputed.\nYour whole newspaper, sir,\nis delivering fake news every day.\n\n\n\n25:24\n\n\nDB: And failing.\n\n\n\n25:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n25:26\n\n\nCA: And failing. My commiserations.\nBut is there any path\nwhereby we can start to get\nsome kind of consensus,\nto believe the same things?\nCan online communities play a role here?\nHow do we fix this?\n\n\n\n25:46\n\n\nGC: See, I understand how that happened.\nThat's another groundswell kind of emotion\nthat was going on in the middle of America\nand not being heard,\nin thinking that the mainstream\nmedia was biased.\nThere's a difference, though,\nbetween being biased and being fake.\nTo me, that is a very important\ndistinction in this conversation.\nSo let's just say that there was some bias\nin the mainstream media.\nOK. So there are ways\nto try and mend that.\nBut what Trump's doing\nis nuclearizing that and saying,\n\"Look, we're just going to call\nall of that fake.\"\nThat's where it gets dangerous.\n\n\n\n26:20\n\n\nCA: Do you think enough of his supporters\nhave a greater loyalty\nto the truth than to any ...\nLike, the principle\nof not supporting something\nthat is demonstrably not true\nactually matters, so there will be\na correction at some point?\n\n\n\n26:37\n\n\nDB: I think the truth\neventually comes out.\nSo for example, Donald Trump\nhas based a lot of his economic policy\non this supposition that Americans\nhave lost manufacturing jobs\nbecause they've been stolen\nby the Chinese.\nThat is maybe 13 percent\nof the jobs that left.\nThe truth is that 87 percent of the jobs\nwere replaced by technology.\nThat is just the truth.\nAnd so as a result, when he says,\n\"I'm going to close TPP\nand all the jobs will come roaring back,\"\nthey will not come roaring back.\nSo that is an actual fact, in my belief.\nAnd —\n\n\n\n27:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n27:10\n\n\nGC: But I'm saying what\nhis supporters think is the truth,\nno matter how many times\nyou might say that,\nthey still believe him.\n\n\n\n27:16\n\n\nDB: But eventually either jobs\nwill come back or they will not come back,\nand at that point, either something\nwill work or it doesn't work,\nand it doesn't work or not work\nbecause of great marketing,\nit works because it actually\naddresses a real problem\nand so I happen to think\nthe truth will out.\n\n\n\n27:31\n\n\nCA: If you've got a question,\nplease raise your hand here.\n\n\n\n27:35\n\n\nYael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.\nMy name's Yael Eisenstat.\nI hear a lot of this talk\nabout how we all need to start\ntalking to each other more\nand understanding each other more,\nand I've even written about this,\npublished on this subject as well,\nbut now today I keep hearing liberals —\nyes, I live in New York,\nI can be considered a liberal —\nwe sit here and self-analyze:\nWhat did we do to not understand\nthe Rust Belt?\nOr: What can we do to understand\nMiddle America better?\nAnd what I'd like to know:\nHave you seen any attempts\nor conversations from Middle America\nof what can I do to understand\nthe so-called coastal elites better?\nBecause I'm just offended\nas being put in a box as a coastal elite\nas someone in Middle America is\nas being considered a flyover state\nand not listened to.\n\n\n\n28:21\n\n\nCA: There you go, I can hear Facebook\ncheering as you —\n\n\n\n28:24\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n28:25\n\n\nDB: I would say — and this is someone\nwho has been conservative\nall my adult life —\nwhen you grow up conservative,\nyou learn to speak both languages.\nBecause if I'm going to listen to music,\nI'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.\nSo a lot of my favorite rock bands\nare all on the left.\nIf I'm going to go to a school,\nI'm going probably to school\nwhere the culture is liberal.\nIf I'm going to watch a sitcom\nor a late-night comedy show,\nit's going to be liberal.\nIf I'm going to read a good newspaper,\nit'll be the New York Times.\nAs a result, you learn\nto speak both languages.\nAnd that actually, at least\nfor a number of years,\nwhen I started at National Review\nwith William F.

be a bigot of some sort.\nSo the political correctness\nwas not only cracking down on speech\nthat we would all find\ncompletely offensive,\nit was cracking down on some speech\nthat was legitimate,\nand then it was turning speech\nand thought into action\nand treating it as a crime,\nand people getting fired\nand people thrown out of schools,\nand there were speech codes written.\nNow there are these diversity teams,\nwhere if you say something\nthat somebody finds offensive,\nlike, \"Smoking is really dangerous,\"\nyou can say \"You're insulting my group,\"\nand the team from the administration\nwill come down into your dorm room\nand put thought police upon you.\nAnd so there has been a genuine narrowing\nof what is permissible to say.\nAnd some of it is legitimate.\nThere are certain words that there\nshould be some social sanction against,\nbut some of it was used\nto enforce a political agenda.\n\n\n\n35:32\n\n\nCA: So is that a project\nyou would urge on liberals,\nif you like — progressives —\nto rethink the ground rules\naround political correctness\nand accept a little more\nuncomfortable language\nin certain circumstances?\nCan you see that being solved\nto an extent that others\nwon't be so offended?\n\n\n\n35:55\n\n\nDB: I mean, most American universities,\nespecially elite universities,\nare overwhelmingly on the left,\nand there's just an ease of temptation\nto use your overwhelming cultural power\nto try to enforce some sort of thought\nthat you think is right\nand correct thought.\nSo, be a little more self-suspicious\nof, are we doing that?\nAnd second, my university,\nthe University of Chicago,\nsent out this letter saying,\nwe will have no safe spaces.\nThere will be no critique\nof micro-aggression.\nIf you get your feelings hurt,\nwell, welcome to the world of education.\nI do think that policy —\nwhich is being embraced by a lot\nof people on the left, by the way —\nis just a corrective to what's happened.\n\n\n\n36:31\n\n\nCA: So here's a question\nfrom Karen Holloway:\nHow do we foster an American culture\nthat's forward-looking, like Hamilton,\nthat expects and deals with change,\nrather than wanting to have everything\ngo back to some fictional past?\nThat's an easy question, right?\n\n\n\n36:47\n\n\nGC: Well, I'm still a believer\nin the American dream,\nand I think what we can teach\nour children is the basics,\nwhich is that hard work\nand believing in yourself\nin America, you can achieve\nwhatever you want.\nI was told that every single day.\nWhen I got in the real world, I was like,\nwow, that's maybe not always so true.\nBut I still believe in that.\nMaybe I'm being too optimistic.\nSo I still look towards the future\nfor that to continue.\n\n\n\n37:16\n\n\nDB: I think you're being too optimistic.\n\n\n\n37:18\n\n\nGC: You do?\n\n\n\n37:19\n\n\nDB: The odds of an American young person\nexceeding their parents' salary —\na generation ago, like 86 percent did it.\nNow 51 percent do it.\nThere's just been a problem\nin social mobility in the country.\n\n\n\n37:31\n\n\nCA: You've written that this entire\ncentury has basically been a disaster,\nthat the age of sunny growth is over\nand we're in deep trouble.\n\n\n\n37:41\n\n\nDB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged,\nin real terms, population-adjusted,\ntwo or three percent growth for 50 years,\nand now we've had less\nthan one percent growth.\nAnd so there's something seeping out.\nAnd so if I'm going to tell people\nthat they should take risks,\none of the things we're seeing\nis a rapid decline in mobility,\nthe number of people who are moving\nacross state lines,\nand that's especially true\namong millennials.\nIt's young people that are moving less.\nSo how do we give people the security\nfrom which they can take risk?\nAnd I'm a big believer in attachment\ntheory of raising children,\nand attachment theory\nis based on the motto\nthat all of life is a series\nof daring adventures from a secure base.\nHave you parents given you a secure base?\nAnd as a society,\nwe do not have a secure base,\nand we won't get to that \"Hamilton,\"\nrisk-taking, energetic ethos\nuntil we can supply a secure base.\n\n\n\n38:36\n\n\nCA: So I wonder whether\nthere's ground here\nto create almost like a shared agenda,\na bridging conversation,\non the one hand recognizing\nthat there is this really deep problem\nthat the system,\nthe economic system that we built,\nseems to be misfiring right now.\nSecond, that maybe, if you're right\nthat it's not all about immigrants,\nit's probably more about technology,\nif you could win that argument,\nthat de-emphasizes what seems to me\nthe single most divisive territory\nbetween Trump supporters and others,\nwhich is around the role of the other.\nIt's very offensive to people on the left\nto have the other demonized\nto the extent that the other\nseems to be demonized.\nThat feels deeply immoral,\nand maybe people on the left\ncould agree, as you said,\nthat immigration\nmay have happened too fast,\nand there is a limit beyond which\nhuman societies struggle,\nbut nonetheless this whole problem\nbecomes de-emphasized\nif automation is the key issue,\nand then we try to work together\non recognizing that it's real,\nrecognizing that the problem\nprobably wasn't properly addressed\nor seen or heard,\nand try to figure out\nhow to rebuild communities\nusing, well, using what?\nThat seems to me to become\nthe fertile conversation of the future:\nHow do we rebuild communities\nin this modern age,\nwith technology doing what it's doing,\nand reimagine this bright future?\n\n\n\n40:05\n\n\nGC: That's why I go back to optimism.\nI'm not being ... it's not like\nI'm not looking at the facts,\nwhere we've come or where we've come from.\nBut for gosh sakes, if we don't look\nat it from an optimistic point of view —\nI'm refusing to do that just yet.\nI'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old\nto say, \"Look, the world is dim.\"\n\n\n\n40:24\n\n\nCA; We're going to have\none more question from the room here.\n\n\n\n40:27\n\n\nQuestioner: Hi.

Sorry.\nYou both mentioned\nthe infrastructure plan and Russia\nand some other things that wouldn't be\ntraditional Republican priorities.\nWhat do you think, or when,\nwill Republicans be motivated\nto take a stand against Trumpism?\n\n\n\n40:50\n\n\nGC: After last night, not for a while.\nHe changed a lot last night, I believe.\n\n\n\n40:56\n\n\nDB: His popularity among Republicans —\nhe's got 85 percent approval,\nwhich is higher than Reagan\nhad at this time,\nand that's because society\nhas just gotten more polarized.\nSo people follow the party\nmuch more than they used to.\nSo if you're waiting for Paul Ryan\nand the Republicans in Congress\nto flake away,\nit's going to take a little while.\n\n\n\n41:13\n\n\nGC: But also because they're all\nconcerned about reelection,\nand Trump has so much power\nwith getting people either for you\nor against you,\nand so, they're vacillating\nevery day, probably:\n\"Well, should I go against\nor should I not?\"\nBut last night, where he finally\nsounded presidential,\nI think most Republicans are breathing\na sigh of relief today.\n\n\n\n41:34\n\n\nDB: The half-life of that is short.\n\n\n\n41:36\n\n\nGC: Right — I was just going to say,\nuntil Twitter happens again.\n\n\n\n41:39\n\n\nCA: OK, I want to give\neach of you the chance\nto imagine you're speaking\nto — I don't know —\nthe people online who are watching this,\nwho may be Trump supporters,\nwho may be on the left,\nsomewhere in the middle.\nHow would you advise them to bridge\nor to relate to other people?\nCan you share any final wisdom on this?\nOr if you think that they shouldn't,\ntell them that as well.\n\n\n\n42:08\n\n\nGC: I would just start by saying\nthat I really think any change\nand coming together starts from the top,\njust like any other organization.\nAnd I would love if, somehow,\nTrump supporters or people on the left\ncould encourage their leaders\nto show that compassion from the top,\nbecause imagine the change\nthat we could have\nif Donald Trump tweeted out today,\nto all of his supporters,\n\"Let's not be vile anymore to each other.\nLet's have more understanding.\nAs a leader, I'm going\nto be more inclusive\nto all of the people of America.\"\nTo me, it starts at the top.\nIs he going to do that? I have no idea.\nBut I think that everything\nstarts from the top,\nand the power that he has\nin encouraging his supporters\nto have an understanding of where\npeople are coming from on the other side.\n\n\n\n43:03\n\n\nCA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say\nI don't think we can teach\neach other to be civil,\nand give us sermons on civility.\nThat's not going to do it.\nIt's substance and how we act,\nand the nice thing about Donald Trump\nis he smashed our categories.\nAll the categories that we thought\nwe were thinking in, they're obsolete.\nThey were great for the 20th century.\nThey're not good for today.\nHe's got an agenda which is about\nclosing borders and closing trade.\nI just don't think it's going to work.\nI think if we want to rebuild\ncommunities, recreate jobs,\nwe need a different set of agenda\nthat smashes through all our current\ndivisions and our current categories.\nFor me, that agenda is Reaganism\non macroeconomic policy,\nSweden on welfare policy\nand cuts across right and left.\nI think we have to have a dynamic\neconomy that creates growth.\nThat's the Reagan on economic policy.\nBut people have to have that secure base.\nThere have to be\nnurse-family partnerships;\nthere has to be universal preschool;\nthere have to be charter schools;\nthere have to be college programs\nwith wraparound programs\nfor parents and communities.\nWe need to help heal the crisis\nof social solidarity in this country\nand help heal families,\nand government just has to get\na lot more involved\nin the way liberals like\nto rebuild communities.\nAt the other hand, we have to have\nan economy that's free and open\nthe way conservatives used to like.\nAnd so getting the substance right\nis how you smash through\nthe partisan identities,\nbecause the substance is what\nultimately shapes our polarization.\n\n\n\n44:29\n\n\nCA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much\nfor an absolutely\nfascinating conversation.\nThank you.

you.\n\n\n\n 6:48\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:55\n\n\nSo, I wanted to leave on a positive note,\nbecause that's the paradox\nthat this life has been:\nin the places where I learned\nto cry the most,\nI also learned how to smile after.\nSo, here goes.\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\n\"You Have a Big Imagination\nor\n400,000 Ways to Cry.\"\n\n\n\n 7:25\n\n\nFor Zeinab.\n\n\n\n 7:27\n\n\nI am a sad girl,\n\n\n\n 7:30\n\n\nbut my face makes other plans,\n\n\n\n 7:33\n\n\nfocusing energy on this smile,\nso as not to waste it on pain.\n\n\n\n 7:37\n\n\nThe first thing they took was my sleep,\n\n\n\n 7:40\n\n\neyes heavy but wide open,\n\n\n\n 7:42\n\n\nthinking maybe I missed something,\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nmaybe the cavalry is still coming.\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nThey didn't come,\n\n\n\n 7:48\n\n\nso I bought bigger pillows.\n\n\n\n 7:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:52\n\n\nMy grandmother could cure anything\n\n\n\n 7:56\n\n\nby talking the life out of it.\n\n\n\n 7:58\n\n\nAnd she said that I could make\na thief in a silo laugh\nin the middle of our raging war.\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nWar makes a broken marriage bed\nout of sorrow.\n\n\n\n 8:09\n\n\nYou want nothing more than to disappear,\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nbut your heart can't salvage\nenough remnants to leave.\n\n\n\n 8:15\n\n\nBut joy —\n\n\n\n 8:17\n\n\njoy is the armor we carried across\nthe borders of our broken homeland.\n\n\n\n 8:23\n\n\nA hasty mix of stories and faces\nthat lasts long after the flavor is gone.\n\n\n\n 8:31\n\n\nA muscle memory that overcomes\neven the most bitter of times,\n\n\n\n 8:34\n\n\nmy memory is spotted with\ndays of laughing until I cried,\n\n\n\n 8:39\n\n\nor crying until I laughed.\n\n\n\n 8:41\n\n\nLaughter and tears are both\ninvoluntary human reactions,\n\n\n\n 8:45\n\n\ntestaments to our capacity for expression.\n\n\n\n 8:48\n\n\nSo allow me to express\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\nthat if I make you laugh,\nit's usually on purpose.\n\n\n\n 8:54\n\n\nAnd if I make you cry,\nI'll still think you are beautiful.\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\nThis is for my cousin Zeinab,\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\nbedridden on a random afternoon.\n\n\n\n 9:05\n\n\nI hadn't seen her since the last time\nwe were in Sudan together,\n\n\n\n 9:09\n\n\nand there I was at her hospital bedside\n\n\n\n 9:13\n\n\nin a 400-year-old building in France.\n\n\n\n 9:18\n\n\nZeinab wanted to hear poems.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nSuddenly, English, Arabic\nand French were not enough.\n\n\n\n 9:25\n\n\nEvery word I knew became empty noise,\n\n\n\n 9:28\n\n\nand Zeinab said, \"Well, get on with it.\"\n\n\n\n 9:30\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:32\n\n\nAnd I read her everything that I could,\nand we laughed,\nand we loved it,\n\n\n\n 9:37\n\n\nand it was the most important stage\nthat I've ever stood on,\n\n\n\n 9:41\n\n\nsurrounded by family,\n\n\n\n 9:43\n\n\nby remnants of a people who were given\nas a dowry to a relentless war\n\n\n\n 9:48\n\n\nbut still managed\nto make pearls of this life;\n\n\n\n 9:51\n\n\nby the ones who taught me\nto not only laugh,\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nbut to live in the face of death;\n\n\n\n 9:58\n\n\nwho placed their hands across the sky,\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nmeasuring the distance to the sun\nand saying, \"Smile;\nI'm gonna meet you there.\"\n\n\n\n10:06\n\n\nAnd for Zeinab —\n\n\n\n10:09\n\n\nZeinab, who taught me love\nin a place like France,\n\n\n\n10:13\n\n\nZeinab, who wanted to

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nChris Anderson:\nElon, hey, welcome back to TED.\nIt's great to have you here.\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\nElon Musk: Thanks for having me.\n\n\n\n 0:17\n\n\nCA: So, in the next half hour or so,\nwe're going to spend some time\nexploring your vision for what\nan exciting future might look like,\nwhich I guess makes\nthe first question a little ironic:\nWhy are you boring?\n\n\n\n 0:32\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nI ask myself that frequently.\nWe're trying to dig a hole under LA,\nand this is to create the beginning\nof what will hopefully\nbe a 3D network of tunnels\nto alleviate congestion.\nSo right now, one of the most\nsoul-destroying things is traffic.\nIt affects people\nin every part of the world.\nIt takes away so much of your life.\nIt's horrible.\nIt's particularly horrible in LA.\n\n\n\n 1:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:11\n\n\nCA: I think you've brought with you\nthe first visualization\nthat's been shown of this.\nCan I show this?\n\n\n\n 1:17\n\n\nEM: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo this is the first time —\nJust to show what we're talking about.\nSo a couple of key things\nthat are important\nin having a 3D tunnel network.\nFirst of all, you have to be able\nto integrate the entrance\nand exit of the tunnel\nseamlessly into the fabric of the city.\nSo by having an elevator,\nsort of a car skate,\nthat's on an elevator,\nyou can integrate the entrance\nand exits to the tunnel network\njust by using two parking spaces.\nAnd then the car gets on a skate.\nThere's no speed limit here,\nso we're designing this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nCA: How much?\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nEM: 200 kilometers an hour,\nor about 130 miles per hour.\nSo you should be able\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX\nin six minutes — five, six minutes.\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nCA: So possibly, initially done,\nit's like on a sort\nof toll road-type basis.\n\n\n\n 2:20\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\nCA: Which, I guess,\nalleviates some traffic\nfrom the surface streets as well.\n\n\n\n 2:25\n\n\nEM: So, I don't know\nif people noticed it in the video,\nbut there's no real limit\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have.\nYou can go much further deep\nthan you can go up.\nThe deepest mines are much deeper\nthan the tallest buildings are tall,\nso you can alleviate any arbitrary\nlevel of urban congestion\nwith a 3D tunnel network.\nThis is a very important point.\nSo a key rebuttal to the tunnels\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels,\nthat will simply alleviate congestion,\nit will get used up,\nand then you'll be back where you started,\nback with congestion.\nBut you can go to any\narbitrary number of tunnels,\nany number of levels.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nCA: But people — seen traditionally,\nit's incredibly expensive to dig,\nand that would block this idea.\n\n\n\n 3:10\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nWell, they're right.\nTo give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension,\nwhich is — I think it's\na two-and-a-half mile extension\nthat was just completed\nfor two billion dollars.\nSo it's roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension in LA.\nAnd this is not the highest\nutility subway in the world.\nSo yeah, it's quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally.\nI think we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement\nin the cost per mile of tunneling.\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\nCA: And how could you achieve that?\n\n\n\n 3:47\n\n\nEM: Actually, if you just do two things,\nyou can get to approximately\nan order of magnitude improvement,\nand I think you can go beyond that.\nSo the first thing to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter\nby a factor of two or more.\nSo a single road lane tunnel\naccording to regulations\nhas to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter\nto allow for crashes\nand emergency vehicles\nand sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion engine cars.\nBut if you shrink that diameter\nto what we're attempting,\nwhich is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through,\nyou drop the diameter by a factor of two\nand the cross-sectional area\nby a factor of four,\nand the tunneling cost scales\nwith the cross-sectional area.\nSo that's roughly a half-order\nof magnitude improvement right there.\nThen tunneling machines currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop,\nand then the rest of the time\nis putting in reinforcements\nfor the tunnel wall.\nSo if you design the machine instead\nto do continuous\ntunneling and reinforcing,\nthat will give you\na factor of two improvement.\nCombine that and that's a factor of eight.\nAlso these machines are far from being\nat their power or thermal limits,\nso you can jack up the power\nto the machine substantially.\nI think you can get\nat least a factor of two,\nmaybe a factor of four or five\nimprovement on top of that.\nSo I think there's a fairly\nstraightforward series of steps\nto get somewhere in excess\nof an order of magnitude improvement\nin the cost per mile,\nand our target actually is —\nwe've got a pet snail called Gary,\nthis is from Gary the snail\nfrom \"South Park,\"\nI mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\"\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nSo Gary is capable of —\ncurrently he's capable\nof going 14 times faster\nthan a tunnel-boring machine.\n\n\n\n 5:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\nCA: You want to beat Gary.\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\nEM: We want to beat Gary.\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:48\n\n\nHe's not a patient little fellow,\nand that will be victory.\nVictory is beating the snail.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nCA: But a lot of people imagining,\ndreaming about future cities,\nthey imagine that actually\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.\nYou go aboveground.\nWhy isn't that a better solution?\nYou save all that tunneling cost.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nEM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.\nObviously, I do rockets,\nso I like things that fly.\nThis is not some inherent bias\nagainst flying things,\nbut there is a challenge with flying cars\nin that they'll be quite noisy,\nthe wind force generated\nwill be very high.\nLet's just say that if something's\nflying over your head,\na whole bunch of flying cars\ngoing all over the place,\nthat is not an anxiety-reducing situation.\n\n\n\n 6:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:44\n\n\nYou don't think to yourself,\n\"Well, I feel better about today.\"\nYou're thinking,\n\"Did they service their hubcap,\nor is it going to come off\nand guillotine me?\"\nThings like that.\n\n\n\n 6:59\n\n\nCA: So you've got this vision\nof future cities with these rich,\n3D networks of tunnels underneath.\nIs there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?\nCould you apply these tunnels\nto use for this Hyperloop idea\nyou released a few years ago.\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so we've been\nsort of puttering around\nwith the Hyperloop stuff for a while.\nWe built a Hyperloop test track\nadjacent to SpaceX,\njust for a student competition,\nto encourage innovative\nideas in transport.\nAnd it actually ends up being\nthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world\nafter the Large Hadron Collider,\nby volume.\nSo it was quite fun to do that,\nbut it was kind of a hobby thing,\nand then we think we might —\nso we've built a little pusher car\nto push the student pods,\nbut we're going to try seeing\nhow fast we can make the pusher go\nif it's not pushing something.\nSo we're cautiously optimistic\nwe'll be able to be faster\nthan the world's fastest bullet train\neven in a .8-mile stretch.\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nCA: Whoa. Good brakes.\n\n\n\n 8:13\n\n\nEM: Yeah, I mean, it's — yeah.\nIt's either going to smash\ninto tiny pieces or go quite fast.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nCA: But you can picture,\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel\nrunning quite long distances.\n\n\n\n 8:26\n\n\nEM: Exactly.\nAnd looking at tunneling technology,\nit turns out that\nin order to make a tunnel,\nyou have to —\nIn order to seal against the water table,\nyou've got to typically design\na tunnel wall to be good\nto about five or six atmospheres.\nSo to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,\nor near-vacuum.\nSo actually, it sort of turns out\nthat automatically,\nif you build a tunnel that is good enough\nto resist the water table,\nit is automatically\ncapable of holding vacuum.\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\nCA: Huh.\n\n\n\n 9:03\n\n\nEM: So, yeah.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nCA: And so you could actually picture,\nwhat kind of length tunnel\nis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nEM: I think there's no real length limit.\nYou could dig as much as you want.\nI think if you were to do something\nlike a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,\nI think you'd probably want\nto go underground the entire way\nbecause it's a high-density area.\nYou're going under\na lot of buildings and houses,\nand if you go deep enough,\nyou cannot detect the tunnel.\nSometimes people think,\nwell, it's going to be pretty annoying\nto have a tunnel dug under my house.\nLike, if that tunnel is dug\nmore than about three or four\ntunnel diameters beneath your house,\nyou will not be able\nto detect it being dug at all.\nIn fact, if you're able\nto detect the tunnel being dug,\nwhatever device you are using,\nyou can get a lot of money\nfor that device from the Israeli military,\nwho is trying to detect\ntunnels from Hamas,\nand from the US Customs and Border patrol\nthat try and detect drug tunnels.\nSo the reality is\nthat earth is incredibly good\nat absorbing vibrations,\nand once the tunnel depth\nis below a certain level,\nit is undetectable.\nMaybe if you have a very sensitive\nseismic instrument,\nyou might be able to detect it.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\nCA: So you've started\na new company to do this\ncalled The Boring Company.\nVery nice. Very funny.\n\n\n\n10:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:35\n\n\nEM: What's funny about that?\n\n\n\n10:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:39\n\n\nCA: How much of your time is this?\n\n\n\n10:42\n\n\nEM: It's maybe ...\ntwo or three percent.\n\n\n\n10:48\n\n\nCA: You've bought a hobby.\nThis is what an Elon Musk\nhobby looks like.\n\n\n\n10:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\nEM: I mean, it really is, like —\nThis is basically interns\nand people doing it part time.\nWe bought some second-hand machinery.\nIt's kind of puttering along,\nbut it's making good progress, so —\n\n\n\n11:11\n\n\nCA: So an even bigger part of your time\nis being spent on electrifying\ncars and transport through Tesla.\nIs one of the motivations\nfor the tunneling project\nthe realization that actually,\nin a world where cars are electric\nand where they're self-driving,\nthere may end up being\nmore cars on the roads\non any given hour than there are now?\n\n\n\n11:33\n\n\nEM: Yeah, exactly.\nA lot of people think\nthat when you make cars autonomous,\nthey'll be able to go faster\nand that will alleviate congestion.\nAnd to some degree that will be true,\nbut once you have shared autonomy\nwhere it's much cheaper to go by car\nand you can go point to point,\nthe affordability of going in a car\nwill be better than that of a bus.\nLike, it will cost less than a bus ticket.\nSo the amount of driving that will occur\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy,\nand actually traffic will get far worse.\n\n\n\n12:11\n\n\nCA: You started Tesla\nwith the goal of persuading the world\nthat electrification\nwas the future of cars,\nand a few years ago,\npeople were laughing at you.\nNow, not so much.\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nEM: OK.\n\n\n\n12:24\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:26\n\n\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\n\n\n12:29\n\n\nCA: But isn't it true that pretty much\nevery auto manufacturer\nhas announced\nserious electrification plans\nfor the short- to medium-term future?\n\n\n\n12:39\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Yeah.\nI think almost every automaker\nhas some electric vehicle program.\nThey vary in seriousness.\nSome are very serious\nabout transitioning entirely to electric,\nand some are just dabbling in it.\nAnd some, amazingly,\nare still pursuing fuel cells,\nbut I think that won't last much longer.\n\n\n\n13:00\n\n\nCA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,\nwhere you can now just declare victory\nand say, you know, \"We did it.\"\nLet the world electrify,\nand you go on and focus on other stuff?\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nI intend to stay with Tesla\nas far into the future as I can imagine,\nand there are a lot of exciting\nthings that we have coming.\nObviously the Model 3 is coming soon.\nWe'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.\n\n\n\n13:31\n\n\nCA: OK, we're going to come to this.\nSo Model 3, it's supposed\nto be coming in July-ish.\n\n\n\n13:38\n\n\nEM: Yeah, it's looking quite good\nfor starting production in July.\n\n\n\n13:42\n\n\nCA: Wow.\nOne of the things\nthat people are so excited about\nis the fact that it's got autopilot.\nAnd you put out this video a while back\nshowing what that technology\nwould look like.\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nThere's obviously autopilot\nin Model S right now.\nWhat are we seeing here?\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so this is using\nonly cameras and GPS.\nSo there's no LIDAR\nor radar being used here.\nThis is just using passive optical,\nwhich is essentially what a person uses.\nThe whole road system\nis meant to be navigated\nwith passive optical, or cameras,\nand so once you solve cameras\nor vision,\nthen autonomy is solved.\nIf you don't solve vision,\nit's not solved.\nSo that's why our focus is\nso heavily on having a vision neural net\nthat's very effective for road conditions.\n\n\n\n14:42\n\n\nCA: Right. Many other people\nare going the LIDAR route.\nYou want cameras plus radar is most of it.\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\nEM: You can absolutely\nbe superhuman with just cameras.\nLike, you can probably do it\nten times better than humans would,\njust cameras.\n\n\n\n14:55\n\n\nCA: So the new cars being sold right now\nhave eight cameras in them.\nThey can't yet do what that showed.\nWhen will they be able to?\n\n\n\n15:07\n\n\nEM: I think we're still on track\nfor being able to go cross-country\nfrom LA to New York by the end\nof the year, fully autonomous.\n\n\n\n15:17\n\n\nCA: OK, so by the end\nof the year, you're saying,\nsomeone's going to sit in a Tesla\nwithout touching the steering wheel,\ntap in \"New York,\" off it goes.\n\n\n\n15:27\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n15:28\n\n\nCA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel —\nby the end of 2017.\n\n\n\n15:33\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Essentially,\nNovember or December of this year,\nwe should be able to go all the way\nfrom a parking lot in California\nto a parking lot in New York,\nno controls touched at any point\nduring the entire journey.\n\n\n\n15:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:49\n\n\nCA: Amazing.\nBut part of that is possible\nbecause you've already got a fleet\nof Teslas driving all these roads.\nYou're accumulating a huge amount\nof data of that national road system.\n\n\n\n16:02\n\n\nEM: Yes, but the thing\nthat will be interesting\nis that I'm actually fairly confident\nit will be able to do that route\neven if you change the route dynamically.\nSo, it's fairly easy —\nIf you say I'm going to be really good\nat one specific route, that's one thing,\nbut it should be able to go,\nreally be very good,\ncertainly once you enter a highway,\nto go anywhere on the highway system\nin a given country.\nSo it's not sort of limited\nto LA to New York.\nWe could change it\nand make it Seattle-Florida,\nthat day, in real time.\nSo you were going from LA to New York.\nNow go from LA to Toronto.\n\n\n\n16:49\n\n\nCA: So leaving aside\nregulation for a second,\nin terms of the technology alone,\nthe time when someone\nwill be able to buy one of your cars\nand literally just take the hands\noff the wheel and go to sleep\nand wake up and find that they've arrived,\nhow far away is that, to do that safely?\n\n\n\n17:06\n\n\nEM: I think that's about two years.\nSo the real trick of it\nis not how do you make it work\nsay 99.9 percent of the time,\nbecause, like, if a car crashes\none in a thousand times,\nthen you're probably still not going\nto be comfortable falling asleep.\nYou shouldn't be, certainly.\n\n\n\n17:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n17:31\n\n\nIt's never going to be perfect.\nNo system is going to be perfect,\nbut if you say it's perhaps —\nthe car is unlikely to crash\nin a hundred lifetimes,\nor a thousand lifetimes,\nthen people are like, OK, wow,\nif I were to live a thousand lives,\nI would still most likely\nnever experience a crash,\nthen that's probably OK.\n\n\n\n17:53\n\n\nCA: To sleep.\nI guess the big concern of yours\nis that people may actually\nget seduced too early\nto think that this is safe,\nand that you'll have some horrible\nincident happen that puts things back.\n\n\n\n18:04\n\n\nEM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash,\nexcept in rare circumstances.\nThe thing to appreciate\nabout vehicle safety\nis this is probabilistic.\nI mean, there's some chance that any time\na human driver gets in a car,\nthat they will have an accident\nthat is their fault.\nIt's never zero.\nSo really the key threshold for autonomy\nis how much better does autonomy\nneed to be than a person\nbefore you can rely on it?\n\n\n\n18:38\n\n\nCA: But once you get\nliterally safe hands-off driving,\nthe power to disrupt\nthe whole industry seems massive,\nbecause at that point you've spoken\nof people being able to buy a car,\ndrops you off at work,\nand then you let it go\nand provide a sort of Uber-like\nservice to other people,\nearn you money,\nmaybe even cover the cost\nof your lease of that car,\nso you can kind of get a car for free.\nIs that really likely?\n\n\n\n19:02\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Absolutely\nthis is what will happen.\nSo there will be a shared autonomy fleet\nwhere you buy your car\nand you can choose\nto use that car exclusively,\nyou could choose to have it be used\nonly by friends and family,\nonly by other drivers\nwho are rated five star,\nyou can choose to share it sometimes\nbut not other times.\nThat's 100 percent what will occur.\nIt's just a question of when.\n\n\n\n19:32\n\n\nCA: Wow.\nSo you mentioned the Semi\nand I think you're planning\nto announce this in September,\nbut I'm curious whether there's\nanything you could show us today?\n\n\n\n19:42\n\n\nEM: I will show you\na teaser shot of the truck.\n\n\n\n19:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:48\n\n\nIt's alive.\n\n\n\n19:50\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n19:51\n\n\nEM: That's definitely a case\nwhere we want to be cautious\nabout the autonomy features.\nYeah.\n\n\n\n19:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n20:00\n\n\nCA: We can't see that much of it,\nbut it doesn't look like\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck.\nIt looks kind of badass.\nWhat sort of semi is this?\n\n\n\n20:10\n\n\nEM: So this is a heavy duty,\nlong-range semitruck.\nSo it's the highest weight capability\nand with long range.\nSo essentially it's meant to alleviate\nthe heavy-duty trucking loads.\nAnd this is something which\npeople do not today think is possible.\nThey think the truck doesn't have enough\npower or it doesn't have enough range,\nand then with the Tesla Semi\nwe want to show that no, an electric truck\nactually can out-torque any diesel semi.\nAnd if you had a tug-of-war competition,\nthe Tesla Semi\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill.\n\n\n\n20:57\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n21:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n21:02\n\n\nCA: That's pretty cool.\nAnd short term, these aren't driverless.\nThese are going to be trucks\nthat truck drivers want to drive.\n\n\n\n21:09\n\n\nEM: Yes. So what will be\nreally fun about this\nis you have a flat torque RPM curve\nwith an electric motor,\nwhereas with a diesel motor or any kind\nof internal combustion engine car,\nyou've got a torque RPM curve\nthat looks like a hill.\nSo this will be a very spry truck.\nYou can drive this\naround like a sports car.\nThere's no gears.\nIt's, like, single speed.\n\n\n\n21:33\n\n\nCA: There's a great movie\nto be made here somewhere.\nI don't know what it is\nand I don't know that it ends well,\nbut it's a great movie.\n\n\n\n21:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n21:40\n\n\nEM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.\nWhen I was driving the test prototype\nfor the first truck.\nIt's really weird,\nbecause you're driving around\nand you're just so nimble,\nand you're in this giant truck.\n\n\n\n21:52\n\n\nCA: Wait, you've\nalready driven a prototype?\n\n\n\n21:56\n\n\nEM: Yeah, I drove it\naround the parking lot,\nand I was like, this is crazy.\n\n\n\n21:59\n\n\nCA: Wow. This is no vaporware.\n\n\n\n22:02\n\n\nEM: It's just like,\ndriving this giant truck\nand making these mad maneuvers.\n\n\n\n22:06\n\n\nCA: This is cool.\nOK, from a really badass picture\nto a kind of less badass picture.\nThis is just a cute house\nfrom \"Desperate Housewives\" or something.\nWhat on earth is going on here?\n\n\n\n22:17\n\n\nEM: Well, this illustrates\nthe picture of the future\nthat I think is how things will evolve.\nYou've got an electric car\nin the driveway.\nIf you look in between\nthe electric car and the house,\nthere are actually three Powerwalls\nstacked up against the side of the house,\nand then that house roof is a solar roof.\nSo that's an actual solar glass roof.\n\n\n\n22:38\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n22:39\n\n\nEM: That's a picture of a real —\nwell, admittedly, it's a real fake house.\nThat's a real fake house.\n\n\n\n22:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n22:48\n\n\nCA: So these roof tiles,\nsome of them have in them\nbasically solar power, the ability to —\n\n\n\n22:56\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles\nwhere you can adjust\nthe texture and the color\nto a very fine-grained level,\nand then there's\nsort of microlouvers in the glass,\nsuch that when you're looking\nat the roof from street level\nor close to street level,\nall the tiles look the same\nwhether there is a solar cell\nbehind it or not.\nSo you have an even color\nfrom the ground level.\nIf you were to look at it\nfrom a helicopter,\nyou would be actually able\nto look through and see\nthat some of the glass tiles have\na solar cell behind them and some do not.\nYou can't tell from street level.\n\n\n\n23:42\n\n\nCA: You put them in the ones\nthat are likely to see a lot of sun,\nand that makes these roofs\nsuper affordable, right?\nThey're not that much more expensive\nthan just tiling the roof.\n\n\n\n23:50\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\nWe're very confident\nthat the cost of the roof\nplus the cost of electricity —\nA solar glass roof will be less\nthan the cost of a normal roof\nplus the cost of electricity.\nSo in other words,\nthis will be economically a no-brainer,\nwe think it will look great,\nand it will last —\nWe thought about having\nthe warranty be infinity,\nbut then people thought,\nwell, that might sound\nlike were just talking rubbish,\nbut actually this is toughened glass.\nWell after the house has collapsed\nand there's nothing there,\nthe glass tiles will still be there.\n\n\n\n24:35\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n24:37\n\n\nCA: I mean, this is cool.\nSo you're rolling this out\nin a couple week's time, I think,\nwith four different roofing types.\n\n\n\n24:44\n\n\nEM: Yeah, we're starting off\nwith two, two initially,\nand the second two\nwill be introduced early next year.\n\n\n\n24:50\n\n\nCA: And what's the scale of ambition here?\nHow many houses do you believe\ncould end up having this type of roofing?\n\n\n\n24:58\n\n\nEM: I think eventually\nalmost all houses will have a solar roof.\nThe thing is to consider\nthe time scale here\nto be probably on the order\nof 40 or 50 years.\nSo on average, a roof\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years.\nBut you don't start replacing\nall roofs immediately.\nBut eventually,\nif you say were to fast-forward\nto say 15 years from now,\nit will be unusual to have a roof\nthat does not have solar.\n\n\n\n25:36\n\n\nCA: Is there a mental model thing\nthat people don't get here\nthat because of the shift in the cost,\nthe economics of solar power,\nmost houses actually have\nenough sunlight on their roof\npretty much to power all of their needs.\nIf you could capture the power,\nit could pretty much\npower all their needs.\nYou could go off-grid, kind of.\n\n\n\n25:55\n\n\nEM: It depends on where you are\nand what the house size is\nrelative to the roof area,\nbut it's a fair statement to say\nthat most houses in the US\nhave enough roof area\nto power all the needs of the house.\n\n\n\n26:10\n\n\nCA: So the key to the economics\nof the cars, the Semi, of these houses\nis the falling price\nof lithium-ion batteries,\nwhich you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.\nIn many ways, that's almost\nthe core competency.\nAnd you've decided\nthat to really, like, own that competency,\nyou just have to build\nthe world's largest manufacturing plant\nto double the world's supply\nof lithium-ion batteries,\nwith this guy. What is this?\n\n\n\n26:43\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,\nprogress so far on the Gigafactory.\nEventually, you can sort of roughly see\nthat there's sort of\na diamond shape overall,\nand when it's fully done,\nit'll look like a giant diamond,\nor that's the idea behind it,\nand it's aligned on true north.\nIt's a small detail.\n\n\n\n27:04\n\n\nCA: And capable of producing, eventually,\nlike a hundred gigawatt hours\nof batteries a year.\n\n\n\n27:11\n\n\nEM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\nWe think probably more, but yeah.\n\n\n\n27:14\n\n\nCA: And they're actually\nbeing produced right now.\n\n\n\n27:17\n\n\nEM: They're in production already.\nCA: You guys put out this video.\nI mean, is that speeded up?\n\n\n\n27:21\n\n\nEM: That's the slowed down version.\n\n\n\n27:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n27:25\n\n\nCA: How fast does it actually go?\n\n\n\n27:27\n\n\nEM: Well, when it's running at full speed,\nyou can't actually see the cells\nwithout a strobe light.\nIt's just blur.\n\n\n\n27:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n27:39\n\n\nCA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\nabout what makes an exciting future\nis a future where we no longer\nfeel guilty about energy.\nHelp us picture this.\nHow many Gigafactories, if you like,\ndoes it take to get us there?\n\n\n\n27:52\n\n\nEM: It's about a hundred, roughly.\nIt's not 10, it's not a thousand.\nMost likely a hundred.\n\n\n\n27:59\n\n\nCA: See, I find this amazing.\nYou can picture what it would take\nto move the world\noff this vast fossil fuel thing.\nIt's like you're building one,\nit costs five billion dollars,\nor whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.\nLike, it's kind of cool\nthat you can picture that project.\nAnd you're planning to do, at Tesla —\nannounce another two this year.\n\n\n\n28:24\n\n\nEM: I think we'll announce locations\nfor somewhere between two\nand four Gigafactories later this year.\nYeah, probably four.\n\n\n\n28:33\n\n\nCA: Whoa.\n\n\n\n28:34\n\n\n(Applause)\nNo more teasing from you for here?\nLike — where, continent?\nYou can say no.\n\n\n\n28:48\n\n\nEM: We need to address a global market.\n\n\n\n28:52\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n28:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n28:54\n\n\nThis is cool.\nI think we should talk for —\nActually, double mark it.\nI'm going to ask you one question\nabout politics, only one.\nI'm kind of sick of politics,\nbut I do want to ask you this.\nYou're on a body now\ngiving advice to a guy —\n\n\n\n29:18\n\n\nEM: Who?\n\n\n\n29:20\n\n\nCA: Who has said he doesn't\nreally believe in climate change,\nand there's a lot of people out there\nwho think you shouldn't be doing that.\nThey'd like you to walk away from that.\nWhat would you say to them?\n\n\n\n29:31\n\n\nEM: Well, I think that first of all,\nI'm just on two advisory councils\nwhere the format consists\nof going around the room\nand asking people's opinion on things,\nand so there's like a meeting\nevery month or two.\nThat's the sum total of my contribution.\nBut I think to the degree\nthat there are people in the room\nwho are arguing in favor\nof doing something about climate change,\nor social issues,\nI've used the meetings I've had thus far\nto argue in favor of immigration\nand in favor of climate change.\n\n\n\n30:13\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n30:15\n\n\nAnd if I hadn't done that,\nthat wasn't on the agenda before.\nSo maybe nothing will happen,\nbut at least the words were said.\n\n\n\n30:25\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n30:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n30:30\n\n\nSo let's talk SpaceX and Mars.\nLast time you were here,\nyou spoke about what seemed like\na kind of incredibly ambitious dream\nto develop rockets\nthat were actually reusable.\nAnd you've only gone and done it.\n\n\n\n30:46\n\n\nEM: Finally. It took a long time.\n\n\n\n30:47\n\n\nCA: Talk us through this.\nWhat are we looking at here?\n\n\n\n30:50\n\n\nEM: So this is one of our rocket boosters\ncoming back from\nvery high and fast in space.\nSo just delivered the upper stage\nat high velocity.\nI think this might have been\nat sort of Mach 7 or so,\ndelivery of the upper stage.\n\n\n\n31:09\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n31:12\n\n\nCA: So that was a sped-up —\n\n\n\n31:14\n\n\nEM: That was the slowed down version.\n\n\n\n31:16\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n31:17\n\n\nCA: I thought that was\nthe sped-up version.\nBut I mean, that's amazing,\nand several of these failed\nbefore you finally\nfigured out how to do it,\nbut now you've done this,\nwhat, five or six times?\n\n\n\n31:28\n\n\nEM: We're at eight or nine.\n\n\n\n31:31\n\n\nCA: And for the first time,\nyou've actually reflown\none of the rockets that landed.\n\n\n\n31:35\n\n\nEM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster\nand then prepped it for flight again\nand flew it again,\nso it's the first reflight\nof an orbital booster\nwhere that reflight is relevant.\nSo it's important to appreciate\nthat reusability is only relevant\nif it is rapid and complete.\nSo like an aircraft or a car,\nthe reusability is rapid and complete.\nYou do not send your aircraft\nto Boeing in-between flights.\n\n\n\n32:07\n\n\nCA: Right. So this is allowing you\nto dream of this really ambitious idea\nof sending many, many, many people to Mars\nin, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.\n\n\n\n32:17\n\n\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n32:19\n\n\nCA: And you've designed\nthis outrageous rocket to do it.\nHelp us understand\nthe scale of this thing.\n\n\n\n32:24\n\n\nEM: Well, visually\nyou can see that's a person.\nYeah, and that's the vehicle.\n\n\n\n32:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n32:35\n\n\nCA: So if that was a skyscraper,\nthat's like, did I read that,\na 40-story skyscraper?\n\n\n\n32:40\n\n\nEM: Probably a little more, yeah.\nThe thrust level of this is really —\nThis configuration is about four times\nthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.\n\n\n\n32:55\n\n\nCA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\nrocket humanity ever created before.\n\n\n\n33:00\n\n\nEM: Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\n\n33:03\n\n\nCA: As one does.\nEM: Yeah.\n\n\n\n33:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n33:08\n\n\nIn units of 747, a 747 is only about\na quarter of a million pounds of thrust,\nso for every 10 million pounds of thrust,\nthere's 40 747s.\nSo this would be the thrust equivalent\nof 120 747s, with all engines blazing.\n\n\n\n33:25\n\n\nCA: And so even with a machine\ndesigned to escape Earth's gravity,\nI think you told me last time\nthis thing could actually\ntake a fully loaded 747,\npeople, cargo, everything,\ninto orbit.\n\n\n\n33:37\n\n\nEM: Exactly. This can take\na fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,\nmaximum passengers,\nmaximum cargo on the 747 —\nthis can take it as cargo.\n\n\n\n33:51\n\n\nCA: So based on this,\nyou presented recently\nthis Interplanetary Transport System\nwhich is visualized this way.\nThis is a scene you picture in, what,\n30 years time? 20 years time?\nPeople walking into this rocket.\n\n\n\n34:08\n\n\nEM: I'm hopeful it's sort of\nan eight- to 10-year time frame.\nAspirationally, that's our target.\nOur internal targets\nare more aggressive, but I think —\n\n\n\n34:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n34:22\n\n\nCA: OK.\n\n\n\n34:23\n\n\nEM: While vehicle seems quite large\nand is large by comparison\nwith other rockets,\nI think the future spacecraft\nwill make this look like a rowboat.\nThe future spaceships\nwill be truly enormous.\n\n\n\n34:42\n\n\nCA: Why, Elon?\nWhy do we need to build a city on Mars\nwith a million people\non it in your lifetime,\nwhich I think is kind of\nwhat you've said you'd love to do?\n\n\n\n34:55\n\n\nEM: I think it's important to have\na future that is inspiring and appealing.\nI just think there have to be reasons\nthat you get up in the morning\nand you want to live.\nLike, why do you want to live?\nWhat's the point? What inspires you?\nWhat do you love about the future?\nAnd if we're not out there,\nif the future does not include\nbeing out there among the stars\nand being a multiplanet species,\nI find that it's incredibly depressing\nif that's not the future\nthat we're going to have.\n\n\n\n35:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n35:31\n\n\nCA: People want to position this\nas an either or,\nthat there are so many desperate things\nhappening on the planet now\nfrom climate to poverty\nto, you know, you pick your issue.\nAnd this feels like a distraction.\nYou shouldn't be thinking about this.\nYou should be solving what's here and now.\nAnd to be fair, you've done\na fair old bit to actually do that\nwith your work on sustainable energy.\nBut why not just do that?\n\n\n\n35:58\n\n\nEM: I think there's —\nI look at the future\nfrom the standpoint of probabilities.\nIt's like a branching\nstream of probabilities,\nand there are actions that we can take\nthat affect those probabilities\nor that accelerate one thing\nor slow down another thing.\nI may introduce something new\nto the probability stream.\nSustainable energy\nwill happen no matter what.\nIf there was no Tesla,\nif Tesla never existed,\nit would have to happen out of necessity.\nIt's tautological.\nIf you don't have sustainable energy,\nit means you have unsustainable energy.\nEventually you will run out,\nand the laws of economics\nwill drive civilization\ntowards sustainable energy,\ninevitably.\nThe fundamental value\nof a company like Tesla\nis the degree to which it accelerates\nthe advent of sustainable energy,\nfaster than it would otherwise occur.\n\n\n\n37:04\n\n\nSo when I think, like,\nwhat is the fundamental good\nof a company like Tesla,\nI would say, hopefully,\nif it accelerated that by a decade,\npotentially more than a decade,\nthat would be quite a good thing to occur.\nThat's what I consider to be\nthe fundamental\naspirational good of Tesla.\n\n\n\n37:24\n\n\nThen there's becoming a multiplanet\nspecies and space-faring civilization.\nThis is not inevitable.\nIt's very important to appreciate\nthis is not inevitable.\nThe sustainable energy future\nI think is largely inevitable,\nbut being a space-faring civilization\nis definitely not inevitable.\nIf you look at the progress in space,\nin 1969 you were able\nto send somebody to the moon.\n1969.\nThen we had the Space Shuttle.\nThe Space Shuttle could only\ntake people to low Earth orbit.\nThen the Space Shuttle retired,\nand the United States\ncould take no one to orbit.\nSo that's the trend.\nThe trend is like down to nothing.\nPeople are mistaken when they think\nthat technology\njust automatically improves.\nIt does not automatically improve.\nIt only improves if a lot of people\nwork very hard to make it better,\nand actually it will, I think,\nby itself degrade, actually.\nYou look at great civilizations\nlike Ancient Egypt,\nand they were able to make the pyramids,\nand they forgot how to do that.\nAnd then the Romans,\nthey built these incredible aqueducts.\nThey forgot how to do it.\n\n\n\n38:39\n\n\nCA: Elon, it almost seems,\nlistening to you\nand looking at the different\nthings you've done,\nthat you've got this unique\ndouble motivation on everything\nthat I find so interesting.\nOne is this desire to work\nfor humanity's long-term good.\nThe other is the desire\nto do something exciting.\nAnd often it feels like you feel\nlike you need the one to drive the other.\nWith Tesla, you want\nto have sustainable energy,\nso you made these super sexy,\nexciting cars to do it.\nSolar energy, we need to get there,\nso we need to make these beautiful roofs.\nWe haven't even spoken\nabout your newest thing,\nwhich we don't have time to do,\nbut you want to save humanity from bad AI,\nand so you're going to create\nthis really cool brain-machine interface\nto give us all infinite memory\nand telepathy and so forth.\nAnd on Mars, it feels\nlike what you're saying is,\nyeah, we need to save humanity\nand have a backup plan,\nbut also we need to inspire humanity,\nand this is a way to inspire.\n\n\n\n39:44\n\n\nEM: I think the value\nof beauty and inspiration\nis very much underrated,\nno question.\nBut I want to be clear.\nI'm not trying to be anyone's savior.\nThat is not the —\nI'm just trying to think about the future\nand not be sad.\n\n\n\n40:03\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n40:05\n\n\nCA: Beautiful statement.\nI think everyone here would agree\nthat it is not —\nNone of this is going\nto happen inevitably.\nThe fact that in your mind,\nyou dream this stuff,\nyou dream stuff that no one else\nwould dare dream,\nor no one else\nwould be capable of dreaming\nat the level of complexity that you do.\nThe fact that you do that, Elon Musk,\nis a really remarkable thing.\nThank you for helping us all\nto dream a bit bigger.\n\n\n\n40:33\n\n\nEM: But you'll tell me if it ever\nstarts getting genuinely insane, right?\n\n\n\n40:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n40:39\n\n\nCA: Thank you, Elon Musk.\nThat was really, really fantastic.\nThat was really fantastic.\n\n\n\n40:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nFresh out of college,\nI went to work for a consulting firm.\nDuring orientation,\nthe leaders dished out advice.\nAmongst them was one pithy counsel\nI will never forget.\nHe told us, \"Be easy to manage.\"\nConsidering how naïve\nI really was at the time,\nI took his advice to heart.\nI told myself,\n\"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.\nI will do everything I'm told.\nI will be easy to manage.\"\nIt wasn't until I arrived\nin graduate school\nand witnessed firsthand the criminal\nactions of scientists and engineers\nin the water crisis in Flint, Michigan\nthat I realized how dangerous\nand yet surprisingly common\nthis line of thinking really is.\n\n\n\n 0:59\n\n\nMake no mistake:\nthe Flint water crisis is one of the most\negregious environmental injustices\nof our time.\nFor over 18 months,\n100,000 residents,\nincluding thousands of young children,\nwere exposed to contaminated\ndrinking water with high levels of lead.\nLead is a potent neurotoxin\nwhich causes cognitive\nand developmental disabilities\nand is especially harmful\nto growing fetuses and young children.\nWe've known about its dangers\nsince the Roman Empire.\nAmongst a whole host of health issues,\n12 people died by contracting\nLegionnaires' disease.\nFlint's water infrastructure —\nthe complex network\nof underground pipes —\nhas been severely damaged.\nAnd while the water quality\nis slowly improving\nand the pipes are being replaced now,\nmore than two years later,\nthe water is still not safe to drink.\n\n\n\n 1:57\n\n\nSo, people are still in shock.\nThey ask themselves,\n\"How could this have happened?\"\nThe short answer is: the crisis began\nwhen an emergency manager,\nappointed by Michigan's governor,\ndecided to switch their water source\nto a local river to save money.\nBut it continued for so long\nbecause scientists and engineers\nat government agencies\nin the state of Michigan\nand in the federal government\ndid not follow federal regulations\nfor treating the water right.\nWhat was more,\nthey actively cheated on the law\nand orchestrated cover-ups.\nThey ridiculed residents asking for help,\nwhile publicly insisting that the brown,\nsmelly water coming out of the tap\nwas safe to drink.\nThe system at the local, state\nand federal levels completely failed\nto protect our most vulnerable,\nand an entire population\nwas left to fend for itself.\n\n\n\n 2:57\n\n\nNow, amidst this injustice,\nFlint residents were rallying together.\nAmongst them were some\namazing women of Flint —\nmothers concerned about their kids —\nwho came together forming\nmany grassroots coalitions,\nand these groups started protesting\nand demanding change.\nThe group also reached out\nto outside scientists for help,\nand a few responded.\nAmongst them was a guy\nnamed Miguel Del Toral,\na water expert at the US EPA —\nthe Environmental Protection Agency —\nwho actually wrote this scientific memo\nand sent it to the state of Michigan\nand the federal government\nto bring their attention to this problem.\nHe was characterized a \"rogue employee,\"\nand silenced.\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\nIn collaboration with Flint residents,\nour research team here at Tech,\nof students and scientists\nled by professor Marc Edwards,\nconducted citywide testing\nto prove that Flint's water\nwas indeed contaminated,\neven toxic in some homes.\nWe substantiated what Flint\nhad been screaming for months,\nand put it on the Internet\nfor the world to see.\n\n\n\n 4:06\n\n\nNow, when I was getting involved,\nwhen I said yes to this,\nI had no idea what I was getting into.\nBut every second of this journey\nhas been totally worth it.\nThis was science\nin service to the public.\nThis is what I came\nto graduate school for,\nand this is how I would rather\nspend my life.\nAnd so this coalition —\nthis unlikely coalition of citizens,\npastors, journalists and scientists —\ncame together to uncover the truth\nusing science, advocacy and activism.\n\n\n\n 4:38\n\n\nA local pediatrician figured out\nthat the instances of childhood\nlead poisoning had indeed doubled\nin Flint during the crisis.\nAnd the state of Michigan was forced\nto acknowledge the problem\nand take steps to correct it.\nThis group and many others\ngot Flint's kids protected.\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nA few months later,\nPresident Obama came in\nand declared a federal emergency,\nand now Flint is getting\nmore than 600 million dollars\nin healthcare, nutrition, education\nand overhauling\ntheir water infrastructure.\nHowever, the arrogance and the callous\ndisregard for public health\nshown by scientists and engineers\nat these government agencies\nis beyond belief.\nThese unhealthy cultures\nthat are festering in these groups,\nwhere the focus is on meeting\nregulations and checking boxes\nas opposed to protecting public health,\nis just appalling.\nJust consider this email\nthat an EPA employee wrote,\nwhere she goes,\n\"I'm not so sure Flint is a community\nwe want to go out on a limb for.\"\nThe dehumanization of an entire population\ncould not be more obvious.\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nNow, contrast that to the first\ncanon of engineering,\nwhich, in my opinion, should be\nthe first law of humanity:\n\"To hold paramount the health,\nsafety and welfare of the public,\"\nabove all else.\nThis is the Hippocratic Oath\nwe've rarely acknowledged,\nlet alone embraced.\nAnd so when scientists and engineers,\nvery much like medical doctors,\nscrew up,\npeople can get hurt —\neven die.\nIf our professionals and even\nstudents fail to get that,\nsociety pays a huge price.\n\n\n\n 6:32\n\n\nBuried deep in history lies\na character I deeply admire —\nan engineer named Peter Palchinsky.\nHe lived in the time of the Soviet Union.\nAnd Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble\nfor his radical honesty\nand willingness to point out major flaws\nin the Soviets' mindless pursuit\nof rapid industrialization.\nEveryone was expected to follow orders\ncoming from the top.\nAnyone asking questions\nor offering feedback was unwelcome.\nThe Soviets had created the largest army\nof engineers the world had ever seen,\nand yet most of them were mere cogs\nin a gigantic machine heading for doom.\nPalchinsky, on the other hand,\nimplored engineers\nto look at the economic, political\nand social consequences of their actions;\nin other words, be more public-focused.\nHis fearless voice of reason\nwas seen as a threat\nto the political establishment,\nand Joseph Stalin\nhad him executed in 1929.\n\n\n\n 7:38\n\n\nPalchinsky's view on technocrats\nis very different\nfrom one that is still very popular,\nstill very common —\nthat of a dispassionate researcher\nworking in his ivory tower lab,\nor a nerdy engineer\nworking in his cubicle.\nBrilliant, no doubt,\nyet somehow cut off from the world,\nshows little emotion —\nkind of like Spock\nfrom \"Star Trek,\" you know?\nThis guy.\n\n\n\n 8:09\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:10\n\n\nLet's try and do the Spock salute.\nI don't think I'll succeed ...\nSee, I can't be Spock.\nThank goodness I can't be Spock.\n\n\n\n 8:19\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:22\n\n\nI was reminded of this distinction\nbecause a recent article came out\nin a very reputed scientific journal,\nwhich kind of characterized our Flint work\nas driven by \"youthful idealism,\"\nand \"Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities.\"\nIt asks scientists to protect\ntheir research funding and institutions\nat all costs, no matter\nhow just the cause.\nAnd if you think you have to get\ninvolved in something,\neven if it's an emergency,\ntry finding an activist group or an NGO,\nand obtain the full support\nof the academic community —\nwhatever that means —\nbefore you get involved.\nNot one mention of our moral\nand professional obligation\nof preventing harm to the public,\nor the fact that we have\nall this expertise,\nresources and, for some, even tenure\nto, you know, accomplish this task.\nI'm not saying every scientist\nshould be an activist.\nThere are real and sometimes very painful\nconsequences of speaking up.\nBut to denounce this idea,\nthis possibility so completely\nso that you can protect research funding,\nsimply screams of self-serving cowardice,\nand these are not the ideals\nwe would want to pass to our students.\n\n\n\n 9:43\n\n\nAnd so you may think,\n\"OK, all this sounds great,\nbut you'll never completely change\norganizational cultures,\nor imbibe mindsets in students\nand professionals\nto look at their work as a public good —\nscience in service to the public.\"\nMaybe so.\nBut could a big reason for that be\nthat we are not training\nour students right?\nBecause if you look closely,\nour education system today\nis focused more on creating\nwhat ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz\ncalls \"excellent sheep\" —\nyoung people who are smart and ambitious,\nand yet somehow risk-averse,\ntimid, directionless\nand, sometimes, full of themselves.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nNow, kids ... you know,\nwe fell in love with science\nwhen we were kids,\nand yet we somehow spend most of our time\nduring high school and college\njust jumping through hoops\nand doing things\nso that we can polish our résumé\ninstead of sitting down\nand reflecting on what we want to do\nand who we want to be.\nAnd so,\nthe markers of empathy\nin our college graduates\nhave been dropping dramatically\nin the past two decades,\nwhile those of narcissism are on the rise.\n\n\n\n11:04\n\n\nThere is also a growing culture\nof disengagement\nbetween engineering students\nand the public.\nWe are trained to build bridges\nand solve complex problems\nbut not how to think or live\nor be a citizen of this world.\nMy undergraduate years\nwere explicit job preparation,\nand I cannot tell you how suffocating\nand painful it was at times.\nAnd so,\nsome people think the solution\nto great engineers, to great scientists,\nis more technical training.\nMaybe so.\nBut where are the discussions\non ethical decision-making,\nor building character,\nor discerning right from wrong?\n\n\n\n11:48\n\n\nConsider this project\nthat I deeply love and admire.\nIt's called, \"Heroic Imagination Project.\"\nA brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,\nfamous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,\nthis program seeks to train\nschool-going children around the world\nto look at themselves\nas heroes-in-waiting,\nor heroes-in-training.\nSo, these young minds work over time\nto develop skills and virtues\nso that when the opportunity comes,\nno matter what that opportunity be,\nto stand up and do the right thing.\nIn other words,\nanyone can be a hero.\n\n\n\n12:29\n\n\nThink about that idea for a second.\nWhy don't we teach science\nand engineering like that —\nwhere heroism and public service\nare seen as key values,\nbecause indeed, it's often heroism\nthat is not only the antidote\nto public indifference,\nbut also to systemic evil\nlike we saw in Flint.\n\n\n\n12:51\n\n\nAnd so, dream with me\nwhat a 21st-century scientist\nslash engineer could look like:\nindividuals who are driven\nto master the sciences\nso that they can serve society,\nand are also aware\nof the tremendous power\ntheir knowledge and decisions have;\nfolks who are developing\ntheir moral courage at all times,\nand who realize that conflict\nand controversy\nare not necessarily bad things\nif our ultimate loyalty\nis to the public and the planet.\n\n\n\n13:21\n\n\nThese are the people who will\nstand up like we did in Flint —\nnot to be saviors or heroes in the media,\nbut altruistic and fundamentally good\nactors that you and I can trust.\nImagine fostering\nsuch a public-focused mindset\nin classes, on service trips\nand during activities\nduring college or even high school,\nso that these young minds\nwill hold onto those ideals\nwhen they actually enter the real world,\nwhether that be consulting,\nacademia, policy making —\nor even becoming\nthe president of a country.\n\n\n\n14:04\n\n\nSome of mankind's greatest\nchallenges lie ahead of us;\ncontaminated drinking water\nis just one example.\nWe could definitely use more —\nnay, we desperately need more —\ncompassionate upstanders\nand public-focused\nscientists and engineers\nwho will strive to the do right thing,\nand not be easy to manage.\n\n\n\n14:25\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n14:27\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI am holding something remarkably old.\nIt is older than any human artifact,\nolder than life on Earth,\nolder than the continents\nand the oceans between them.\nThis was formed\nover four billion years ago\nin the earliest days of the solar system\nwhile the planets were still forming.\nThis rusty lump of nickel and iron\nmay not appear special,\nbut when it is cut open ...\nyou can see that it is different\nfrom earthly metals.\nThis pattern reveals metallic crystals\nthat can only form out in space\nwhere molten metal\ncan cool extremely slowly,\na few degrees every million years.\nThis was once part\nof a much larger object,\none of millions left over\nafter the planets formed.\nWe call these objects asteroids.\n\n\n\n 1:00\n\n\nAsteroids are our oldest\nand most numerous cosmic neighbors.\nThis graphic shows near-Earth asteroids\norbiting around the Sun,\nshown in yellow,\nand swinging close to the Earth's orbit,\nshown in blue.\nThe sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids\nhave been greatly exaggerated\nso you can see them clearly.\nTeams of scientists across the globe\nare searching for these objects,\ndiscovering new ones every day,\nsteadily mapping near-Earth space.\nMuch of this work is funded by NASA.\nI think of the search for these asteroids\nas a giant public works project,\nbut instead of building a highway,\nwe're charting outer space,\nbuilding an archive\nthat will last for generations.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nThese are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids\ndiscovered just last year.\nAnd these are all of the known\nnear-Earth asteroids,\nwhich at last count was 13,733.\nEach one has been imaged, cataloged\nand had its path\naround the Sun determined.\nAlthough it varies\nfrom asteroid to asteroid,\nthe paths of most asteroids\ncan be predicted for dozens of years.\nAnd the paths of some asteroids can be\npredicted with incredible precision.\nFor example, scientists\nat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\npredicted where the asteroid Toutatis\nwas going to be four years in advance\nto within 30 kilometers.\nIn those four years,\nToutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.\nThat's a fractional precision\nof 0.000000004.\n\n\n\n 2:30\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nNow, the reason I have\nthis beautiful asteroid fragment\nis because, like all neighbors,\nasteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.\n\n\n\n 2:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nThree years ago today,\na small asteroid exploded\nover the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.\nThat object was about 19 meters across,\nor about as big as a convenience store.\nObjects of this size hit the Earth\nevery 50 years or so.\n\n\n\n 2:58\n\n\n66 million years ago,\na much larger object hit the Earth,\ncausing a massive extinction.\n75 percent of plant\nand animal species were lost,\nincluding, sadly, the dinosaurs.\nThat object was\nabout 10 kilometers across,\nand 10 kilometers is roughly\nthe cruising altitude of a 747 jet.\nSo the next time you're in an airplane,\nsnag a window seat, look out\nand imagine a rock so enormous\nthat resting on the ground,\nit just grazes your wingtip.\nIt's so wide that it takes your plane\none full minute to fly past it.\nThat's the size of the asteroid\nthat hit the Earth.\n\n\n\n 3:35\n\n\nIt has only been within my lifetime\nthat asteroids have been considered\na credible threat to our planet.\nAnd since then, there's been\na focused effort underway\nto discover and catalog these objects.\nI am lucky enough\nto be part of this effort.\nI'm part of a team of scientists\nthat use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.\nNow, NEOWISE was not\ndesigned to find asteroids.\nIt was designed to orbit the earth\nand look far beyond our solar system\nto seek out the coldest stars\nand the most luminous galaxies.\nAnd it did that very well\nfor its designed lifetime of seven months.\nBut today, six years later,\nit's still going.\nWe've repurposed it\nto discover and study asteroids.\nAnd although it's\na wonderful little space robot,\nthese days it's kind of like a used car.\nThe cryogen that used to refrigerate\nits sensors is long gone,\nso we joke that\nits air-conditioning is broken.\nIt's got 920 million miles\non the odometer,\nbut it still runs great\nand reliably takes a photograph\nof the sky every 11 seconds.\nIt's taken 23 photos\nsince I began speaking to you.\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nOne of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable\nis that it sees the sky\nin the thermal infrared.\nThat means that instead of seeing\nthe sunlight that asteroids reflect,\nNEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.\nThis is a vital capability\nsince some asteroids are as dark as coal\nand can be difficult or impossible\nto spot with other telescopes.\nBut all asteroids, light or dark,\nshine brightly for NEOWISE.\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nAstronomers are using\nevery technique at their disposal\nto discover and study asteroids.\nIn 2010, a historic milestone was reached.\nThe community, together, discovered\nover 90 percent of asteroids\nbigger than one kilometer across —\nobjects capable\nof massive destruction to Earth.\nBut the job's not done yet.\nAn object 140 meters or bigger\ncould decimate a medium-sized country.\nSo far, we've only found\n25 percent of those.\n\n\n\n 5:27\n\n\nWe must keep searching the sky\nfor near-Earth asteroids.\nWe are the only species\nable to understand calculus\nor build telescopes.\nWe know how to find these objects.\nThis is our responsibility.\nIf we found a hazardous asteroid\nwith significant early warning,\nwe could nudge it out of the way.\nUnlike earthquakes, hurricanes\nor volcanic eruptions,\nan asteroid impact\ncan be precisely predicted\nand prevented.\nWhat we need to do now\nis map near-Earth space.\nWe must keep searching the sky.\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 5:58\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nScience.\nThe very word for many of you conjures\nunhappy memories of boredom\nin high school biology or physics class.\nBut let me assure that what you did there\nhad very little to do with science.\nThat was really the \"what\" of science.\nIt was the history\nof what other people had discovered.\nWhat I'm most interested in as a scientist\nis the \"how\" of science.\nBecause science is knowledge in process.\nWe make an observation,\nguess an explanation for that observation,\nand then make a prediction\nthat we can test\nwith an experiment or other observation.\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\nA couple of examples.\nFirst of all, people noticed\nthat the Earth was below, the sky above,\nand both the Sun and the Moon\nseemed to go around them.\nTheir guessed explanation\nwas that the Earth must be\nthe center of the universe.\nThe prediction: everything\nshould circle around the Earth.\nThis was first really tested\nwhen Galileo got his hands\non one of the first telescopes,\nand as he gazed into the night sky,\nwhat he found there was a planet, Jupiter,\nwith four moons circling around it.\nHe then used those moons\nto follow the path of Jupiter\nand found that Jupiter\nalso was not going around the Earth\nbut around the Sun.\nSo the prediction test failed.\nAnd this led to\nthe discarding of the theory\nthat the Earth was the center\nof the universe.\n\n\n\n 1:41\n\n\nAnother example: Sir Isaac Newton\nnoticed that things fall to the Earth.\nThe guessed explanation was gravity,\nthe prediction that everything\nshould fall to the Earth.\nBut of course, not everything\ndoes fall to the Earth.\nSo did we discard gravity?\nNo. We revised the theory and said,\ngravity pulls things to the Earth\nunless there is an equal\nand opposite force in the other direction.\nThis led us to learn something new.\nWe began to pay more attention\nto the bird and the bird's wings,\nand just think of all the discoveries\nthat have flown\nfrom that line of thinking.\nSo the test failures,\nthe exceptions, the outliers\nteach us what we don't know\nand lead us to something new.\nThis is how science moves forward.\nThis is how science learns.\n\n\n\n 2:34\n\n\nSometimes in the media,\nand even more rarely,\nbut sometimes even scientists will say\nthat something or other\nhas been scientifically proven.\nBut I hope that you understand\nthat science never proves anything\ndefinitively forever.\nHopefully science remains curious enough\nto look for\nand humble enough to recognize\nwhen we have found\nthe next outlier,\nthe next exception,\nwhich, like Jupiter's moons,\nteaches us what we don't actually know.\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\nWe're going to change gears\nhere for a second.\nThe caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,\nmeans a lot of different things\nto different people,\nbut most of our\npublic discourse on medicine\nreally turns it into\nan engineering problem.\nWe have the hallways of Congress,\nand the boardrooms of insurance companies\nthat try to figure out how to pay for it.\nThe ethicists and epidemiologists\ntry to figure out\nhow best to distribute medicine,\nand the hospitals and physicians\nare absolutely obsessed\nwith their protocols and checklists,\ntrying to figure out\nhow best to safely apply medicine.\nThese are all good things.\nHowever, they also all assume\nat some level\nthat the textbook of medicine is closed.\nWe start to measure\nthe quality of our health care\nby how quickly we can access it.\nIt doesn't surprise me\nthat in this climate,\nmany of our institutions\nfor the provision of health care\nstart to look a heck of a lot\nlike Jiffy Lube.\n\n\n\n 4:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:05\n\n\nThe only problem is that\nwhen I graduated from medical school,\nI didn't get one of those\nlittle doohickeys\nthat your mechanic\nhas to plug into your car\nand find out exactly what's wrong with it,\nbecause the textbook of medicine\nis not closed.\nMedicine is science.\nMedicine is knowledge in process.\nWe make an observation,\nwe guess an explanation\nof that observation,\nand then we make a prediction\nthat we can test.\nNow, the testing ground\nof most predictions in medicine\nis populations.\nAnd you may remember\nfrom those boring days in biology class\nthat populations tend to distribute\naround a mean\nas a Gaussian or a normal curve.\nTherefore, in medicine,\nafter we make a prediction\nfrom a guessed explanation,\nwe test it in a population.\nThat means that what we know in medicine,\nour knowledge and our know-how,\ncomes from populations\nbut extends only as far\nas the next outlier,\nthe next exception,\nwhich, like Jupiter's moons,\nwill teach us what we don't actually know.\n\n\n\n 5:13\n\n\nNow, I am a surgeon\nwho looks after patients with sarcoma.\nSarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.\nIt's the cancer of flesh and bones.\nAnd I would tell you that every one\nof my patients is an outlier,\nis an exception.\nThere is no surgery I have ever performed\nfor a sarcoma patient\nthat has ever been guided\nby a randomized controlled clinical trial,\nwhat we consider the best kind\nof population-based evidence in medicine.\nPeople talk about thinking\noutside the box,\nbut we don't even have a box in sarcoma.\nWhat we do have as we take\na bath in the uncertainty\nand unknowns and exceptions\nand outliers that surround us in sarcoma\nis easy access to what I think\nare those two most important values\nfor any science:\nhumility and curiosity.\nBecause if I am humble and curious,\nwhen a patient asks me a question,\nand I don't know the answer,\nI'll ask a colleague\nwho may have a similar\nalbeit distinct patient with sarcoma.\nWe'll even establish\ninternational collaborations.\nThose patients will start\nto talk to each other through chat rooms\nand support groups.\nIt's through this kind\nof humbly curious communication\nthat we begin to try and learn new things.\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\nAs an example, this is a patient of mine\nwho had a cancer near his knee.\nBecause of humbly curious communication\nin international collaborations,\nwe have learned that we can repurpose\nthe ankle to serve as the knee\nwhen we have to remove the knee\nwith the cancer.\nHe can then wear a prosthetic\nand run and jump and play.\nThis opportunity was available to him\nbecause of international collaborations.\nIt was desirable to him\nbecause he had contacted other patients\nwho had experienced it.\nAnd so exceptions and outliers in medicine\nteach us what we don't know,\nbut also lead us to new thinking.\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nNow, very importantly,\nall the new thinking that outliers\nand exceptions lead us to in medicine\ndoes not only apply\nto the outliers and exceptions.\nIt is not that we only learn\nfrom sarcoma patients\nways to manage sarcoma patients.\nSometimes, the outliers\nand the exceptions\nteach us things that matter quite a lot\nto the general population.\nLike a tree standing outside a forest,\nthe outliers and the exceptions\ndraw our attention\nand lead us into a much greater sense\nof perhaps what a tree is.\nWe often talk about\nlosing the forests for the trees,\nbut one also loses a tree\nwithin a forest.\nBut the tree that stands out by itself\nmakes those relationships\nthat define a tree,\nthe relationships between trunk\nand roots and branches,\nmuch more apparent.\nEven if that tree is crooked\nor even if that tree\nhas very unusual relationships\nbetween trunk and roots and branches,\nit nonetheless draws our attention\nand allows us to make observations\nthat we can then test\nin the general population.\n\n\n\n 8:17\n\n\nI told you that sarcomas are rare.\nThey make up about one percent\nof all cancers.\nYou also probably know that cancer\nis considered a genetic disease.\nBy genetic disease we mean\nthat cancer is caused by oncogenes\nthat are turned on in cancer\nand tumor suppressor genes\nthat are turned off to cause cancer.\nYou might think\nthat we learned about oncogenes\nand tumor suppressor genes\nfrom common cancers\nlike breast cancer and prostate cancer\nand lung cancer,\nbut you'd be wrong.\nWe learned about oncogenes\nand tumor suppressor genes\nfor the first time\nin that itty-bitty little one percent\nof cancers called sarcoma.\nIn 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize\nfor realizing that chickens\nhad a transmissible form of sarcoma.\nThirty years later, Harold Varmus\nand Mike Bishop discovered\nwhat that transmissible element was.\nIt was a virus\ncarrying a gene,\nthe src oncogene.\nNow, I will not tell you\nthat src is the most important oncogene.\nI will not tell you\nthat src is the most frequently\nturned on oncogene in all of cancer.\nBut it was the first oncogene.\nThe exception, the outlier\ndrew our attention and led us to something\nthat taught us very important things\nabout the rest of biology.\n\n\n\n 9:35\n\n\nNow, TP53 is the most important\ntumor suppressor gene.\nIt is the most frequently turned off\ntumor suppressor gene\nin almost every kind of cancer.\nBut we didn't learn about it\nfrom common cancers.\nWe learned about it\nwhen doctors Li and Fraumeni\nwere looking at families,\nand they realized that these families\nhad way too many sarcomas.\nI told you that sarcoma is rare.\nRemember that a one\nin a million diagnosis,\nif it happens twice in one family,\nis way too common in that family.\nThe very fact that these are rare\ndraws our attention\nand leads us to new kinds of thinking.\n\n\n\n10:16\n\n\nNow, many of you may say,\nand may rightly say,\nthat yeah, Kevin, that's great,\nbut you're not talking\nabout a bird's wing.\nYou're not talking about moons\nfloating around some planet Jupiter.\nThis is a person.\nThis outlier, this exception,\nmay lead to the advancement of science,\nbut this is a person.\nAnd all I can say\nis that I know that all too well.\nI have conversations with these patients\nwith rare and deadly diseases.\nI write about these conversations.\nThese conversations are terribly fraught.\nThey're fraught with horrible phrases\nlike \"I have bad news\"\nor \"There's nothing more we can do.\"\nSometimes these conversations\nturn on a single word:\n\"terminal.\"\n\n\n\n11:03\n\n\nSilence can also be rather uncomfortable.\nWhere the blanks are in medicine\ncan be just as important\nas the words that we use\nin these conversations.\nWhat are the unknowns?\nWhat are the experiments\nthat are being done?\n\n\n\n11:20\n\n\nDo this little exercise with me.\nUp there on the screen,\nyou see this phrase, \"no where.\"\nNotice where the blank is.\nIf we move that blank one space over\n\"no where\"\nbecomes \"now here,\"\nthe exact opposite meaning,\njust by shifting the blank one space over.\n\n\n\n11:42\n\n\nI'll never forget the night\nthat I walked into\none of my patients' rooms.\nI had been operating long that day\nbut I still wanted to come and see him.\nHe was a boy I had diagnosed\nwith a bone cancer a few days before.\nHe and his mother had been meeting\nwith the chemotherapy doctors\nearlier that day,\nand he had been admitted\nto the hospital to begin chemotherapy.\nIt was almost midnight\nwhen I got to his room.\nHe was asleep, but I found his mother\nreading by flashlight\nnext to his bed.\nShe came out in the hall\nto chat with me for a few minutes.\nIt turned out that\nwhat she had been reading\nwas the protocol\nthat the chemotherapy doctors\nhad given her that day.\nShe had memorized it.\nShe said, \"Dr. Jones, you told me\nthat we don't always win\nwith this type of cancer,\nbut I've been studying this protocol,\nand I think I can do it.\nI think I can comply\nwith these very difficult treatments.\nI'm going to quit my job.\nI'm going to move in with my parents.\nI'm going to keep my baby safe.\"\nI didn't tell her.\nI didn't stop to correct her thinking.\nShe was trusting in a protocol\nthat even if complied with,\nwouldn't necessarily save her son.\nI didn't tell her.\nI didn't fill in that blank.\nBut a year and a half later\nher boy nonetheless died of his cancer.\nShould I have told her?\n\n\n\n13:16\n\n\nNow, many of you may say, \"So what?\nI don't have sarcoma.\nNo one in my family has sarcoma.\nAnd this is all fine and well,\nbut it probably doesn't\nmatter in my life.\"\nAnd you're probably right.\nSarcoma may not matter\na whole lot in your life.\nBut where the blanks are in medicine\ndoes matter in your life.\n\n\n\n13:37\n\n\nI didn't tell you one dirty little secret.\nI told you that in medicine,\nwe test predictions in populations,\nbut I didn't tell you,\nand so often medicine never tells you\nthat every time an individual\nencounters medicine,\neven if that individual is firmly\nembedded in the general population,\nneither the individual\nnor the physician knows\nwhere in that population\nthe individual will land.\nTherefore, every encounter with medicine\nis an experiment.\nYou will be a subject\nin an experiment.\nAnd the outcome will be either\na better or a worse result for you.\nAs long as medicine works well,\nwe're fine with fast service,\nbravado, brimmingly\nconfident conversations.\nBut when things don't work well,\nsometimes we want something different.\n\n\n\n14:33\n\n\nA colleague of mine\nremoved a tumor from a patient's limb.\nHe was concerned about this tumor.\nIn our physician conferences,\nhe talked about his concern\nthat this was a type of tumor\nthat had a high risk\nfor coming back in the same limb.\nBut his conversations with the patient\nwere exactly what a patient might want:\nbrimming with confidence.\nHe said, \"I got it all\nand you're good to go.\"\nShe and her husband were thrilled.\nThey went out, celebrated, fancy dinner,\nopened a bottle of champagne.\nThe only problem was a few weeks later,\nshe started to notice\nanother nodule in the same area.\nIt turned out he hadn't gotten it all,\nand she wasn't good to go.\nBut what happened at this juncture\nabsolutely fascinates me.\nMy colleague came to me and said,\n\"Kevin, would you mind\nlooking after this patient for me?\"\nI said, \"Why, you know the right thing\nto do as well as I do.\nYou haven't done anything wrong.\"\nHe said, \"Please, just look\nafter this patient for me.\"\nHe was embarrassed —\nnot by what he had done,\nbut by the conversation that he had had,\nby the overconfidence.\n\n\n\n15:41\n\n\nSo I performed\na much more invasive surgery\nand had a very different conversation\nwith the patient afterwards.\nI said, \"Most likely I've gotten it all\nand you're most likely good to go,\nbut this is the experiment\nthat we're doing.\nThis is what you're going to watch for.\nThis is what I'm going to watch for.\nAnd we're going to work together\nto find out if this surgery will work\nto get rid of your cancer.\"\nI can guarantee you, she and her husband\ndid not crack another bottle of champagne\nafter talking to me.\nBut she was now a scientist,\nnot only a subject in her experiment.\n\n\n\n16:20\n\n\nAnd so I encourage you\nto seek humility and curiosity\nin your physicians.\nAlmost 20 billion times each year,\na person walks into a doctor's office,\nand that person becomes a patient.\nYou or someone you love\nwill be that patient sometime very soon.\nHow will you talk to your doctors?\nWhat will you tell them?\nWhat will they tell you?\nThey cannot tell you\nwhat they do not know,\nbut they can tell you when they don't know\nif only you'll ask.\nSo please, join the conversation.\n\n\n\n17:07\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n17:08\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIn 1987, Tina Lord\nfound herself in quite the pickle.\nSee, this gold digger made sure\nshe married sweet Cord Roberts\njust before he inherited millions.\nBut when Cord found out\nTina loved his money\nas much as she loved him,\nhe dumped her.\nCord's mother Maria was thrilled\nuntil they hooked up again.\nSo Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina\nand then made sure Cord didn't find out\nTina was pregnant with his baby.\nSo Tina, still married\nbut thinking Cord didn't love her\nflew to Argentina with Max.\nCord finally figured out what was going on\nand rushed after them,\nbut he was too late.\nTina had already been kidnapped,\nstrapped to a raft\nand sent over a waterfall.\nShe and her baby were presumed dead.\nCord was sad for a bit,\nbut then he bounced right back\nwith a supersmart\narchaeologist named Kate,\nand they had a gorgeous wedding\nuntil Tina, seemingly back from the dead,\nran into the church holding a baby.\n\"Stop!\" she screamed.\n\"Am I too late?\nCord, I've come so far.\nThis is your son.\"\n\n\n\n 1:18\n\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen,\nis how the soap opera \"One Life to Live\"\nintroduced a love story\nthat lasted 25 years.\n\n\n\n 1:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:26\n\n\nNow, if you've ever seen a soap opera,\nyou know the stories and the characters\ncan be exaggerated, larger than life,\nand if you're a fan,\nyou find that exaggeration fun,\nand if you're not,\nmaybe you find them\nmelodramatic or unsophisticated.\nMaybe you think watching soap operas\nis a waste of time,\nthat their bigness means\ntheir lessons are small or nonexistent.\nBut I believe the opposite to be true.\nSoap operas reflect life, just bigger.\nSo there are real life lessons\nwe can learn from soap operas,\nand those lessons\nare as big and adventurous\nas any soap opera storyline.\n\n\n\n 2:06\n\n\nNow, I've been a fan since I ran home\nfrom the bus stop in second grade\ndesperate to catch the end\nof Luke and Laura's wedding,\nthe biggest moment\nin \"General Hospital\" history.\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:17\n\n\nSo you can imagine\nhow much I loved my eight years\nas the assistant casting director\non \"As the World Turns.\"\nMy job was watching soap operas,\nreading soap opera scripts\nand auditioning actors\nto be on soap operas.\nSo I know my stuff.\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nAnd yes, soap operas\nare larger than life,\ndrama on a grand scale,\nbut our lives can be filled\nwith as much intensity,\nand the stakes can feel just as dramatic.\nWe cycle through tragedy and joy\njust like these characters.\nWe cross thresholds, fight demons\nand find salvation unexpectedly,\nand we do it again and again and again,\nbut just like soaps,\nwe can flip the script,\nwhich means we can learn\nfrom these characters\nthat move like bumblebees,\nlooping and swerving through life.\nAnd we can use those lessons\nto craft our own life stories.\nSoap operas teach us to push away doubt\nand believe in our capacity\nfor bravery, vulnerability,\nadaptability and resilience.\nAnd most importantly, they show us\nit's never too late to change your story.\n\n\n\n 3:30\n\n\nSo with that, let's start\nwith soap opera lesson one:\nsurrender is not an option.\n\n\n\n 3:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:37\n\n\n\"All My Children\"'s Erica Kane\nwas daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,\na hyperbolically self-important princess\nwho deep down was scrappy and daring.\nNow, in her 41 years on TV,\nperhaps Erica's most famous scene\nis her alone in the woods\nsuddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.\nShe screamed at the bear,\n\"You may not do this!\nDo you understand me?\nYou may not come near me!\nI am Erica Kane\nand you are a filthy beast!\"\n\n\n\n 4:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:09\n\n\nAnd of course the bear left,\nso what that teaches us\nis obstacles are to be expected\nand we can choose to surrender\nor we can stand and fight.\n\n\n\n 4:20\n\n\nPandora's Tim Westergren\nknows this better than most.\nYou might even call him\nthe Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.\nTim and his cofounders\nlaunched the company\nwith two million dollars in funding.\nThey were out of cash the next year.\nNow, lots of companies fold at that point,\nbut Tim chose to fight.\nHe maxed out 11 credit cards\nand racked up six figures in personal debt\nand it still wasn't enough.\nSo every two weeks for two years on payday\nhe stood in front of his employees\nand he asked them\nto sacrifice their salaries,\nand it worked.\nMore than 50 people deferred\ntwo million dollars,\nand now, more than a decade later,\nPandora is worth billions.\nWhen you believe that there is a way\naround or through\nwhatever is in front of you,\nthat surrender is not an option,\nyou can overcome enormous obstacles.\n\n\n\n 5:12\n\n\nWhich brings us to soap opera lesson two:\nsacrifice your ego\nand drop the superiority complex.\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nNow, this is scary.\nIt's an acknowledgment\nof need or fallibility.\nMaybe it's even an admission\nthat we're not as special\nas we might like to think.\nStephanie Forrester\nof \"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\nthought she was pretty darn special.\nShe thought she was so special,\nshe didn't need to mix\nwith the riffraff from the valley,\nand she made sure\nvalley girl Brooke knew it.\nBut after nearly 25 years\nof epic fighting,\nStephanie got sick and let Brooke in.\nThey made amends,\narchenemies became soul mates\nand Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,\nand here's our takeaway.\nDrop your ego.\nLife is not about you.\nIt's about us,\nand our ability to experience joy\nand love and to improve our reality\ncomes only when we make\nourselves vulnerable\nand we accept responsibility\nfor our actions\nand our inactions,\nkind of like Howard Schultz,\nthe CEO of Starbucks.\n\n\n\n 6:17\n\n\nNow, after a great run as CEO,\nHoward stepped down in 2000,\nand Starbucks quickly overextended itself\nand stock prices fell.\nHoward rejoined the team in 2008,\nand one of the first things he did\nwas apologize to all 180,000 employees.\nHe apologized.\nAnd then he asked for help,\nhonesty, and ideas in return.\nAnd now, Starbucks has more than doubled\nits net revenue since Howard came back.\nSo sacrifice your desire\nto be right or safe all the time.\nIt's not helping anyone, least of all you.\nSacrifice your ego.\n\n\n\n 6:58\n\n\nSoap opera lesson three:\nevolution is real.\nYou're not meant to be static characters.\nOn television, static equals boring\nand boring equals fired.\nCharacters are supposed\nto grow and change.\nNow, on TV, those dynamic changes\ncan make for some rough transitions,\nparticularly when a character\nis played by one person yesterday\nand played by someone new today.\nRecasting happens all the time on soaps.\nOver the last 20 years,\nfour different actors\nhave played the same key role\nof Carly Benson on \"General Hospital.\"\nEach new face triggered a change\nin the character's life and personality.\nNow, there was always\nan essential nugget of Carly in there,\nbut the character and the story\nadapted to whomever was playing her.\n\n\n\n 7:50\n\n\nAnd here's what that means for us.\nWhile we may not swap faces\nin our own lives,\nwe can evolve too.\nWe can choose to draw a circle\naround our feet and stay in that spot,\nor we can open ourselves to opportunities\nlike Carly, who went\nfrom nursing student to hotel owner,\nor like Julia Child.\n\n\n\n 8:12\n\n\nJulia was a World War II spy,\nand when the war ended,\nshe got married, moved to France,\nand decided to give\nculinary school a shot.\nJulia, her books and her TV shows\nrevolutionized the way America cooks.\n\n\n\n 8:28\n\n\nWe all have the power\nto initiate change in our lives,\nto evolve and adapt.\nWe make the choice,\nbut sometimes life chooses for us,\nand we don't get a heads up.\nSurprise slams us in the face.\nYou're flat on the ground,\nthe air is gone,\nand you need resuscitation.\n\n\n\n 8:46\n\n\nSo thank goodness\nfor soap opera lesson four:\nresurrection is possible.\n\n\n\n 8:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:53\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:57\n\n\nIn 1983, \"Days of Our Lives\"'\nStefano DiMera died of a stroke,\nbut not really, because in 1984\nhe died when his car\nplunged into the harbor,\nand yet he was back in 1985\nwith a brain tumor.\n\n\n\n 9:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nBut before the tumor could kill him,\nMarlena shot him, and he tumbled\noff a catwalk to his death.\nAnd so it went for 30 years.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:24\n\n\nEven when we saw the body,\nwe knew better.\nHe's called the Phoenix for a reason.\nAnd here's what that means for us.\nAs long as the show is still on the air,\nor you're still breathing,\nnothing is permanent.\nResurrection is possible.\n\n\n\n 9:44\n\n\nNow, of course, just like life,\nsoap operas do ultimately\nmeet the big finale.\nCBS canceled my show,\n\"As The World Turns,\" in December 2009,\nand we shot our final episode\nin June 2010.\nIt was six months of dying\nand I rode that train\nright into the mountain.\nAnd even though we were\nin the middle of a huge recession\nand millions of people\nwere struggling to find work,\nI somehow thought everything would be OK.\nSo I packed up the kids\nand the Brooklyn apartment,\nand we moved in with my in-laws\nin Alabama.\n\n\n\n10:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:23\n\n\nThree months later, nothing was OK.\nThat was when I watched\nthe final episode air,\nand I realized the show\nwas not the only fatality.\nI was one too.\nI was unemployed\nand living on the second floor\nof my in-laws' home,\nand that's enough\nto make anyone feel dead inside.\n\n\n\n10:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:47\n\n\nBut I knew my story wasn't over,\nthat it couldn't be over.\nI just had to tap into everything\nI had ever learned about soap operas.\nI had to be brave like Erica\nand refuse to surrender,\nso every day, I made a decision to fight.\nI had to be vulnerable like Stephanie\nand sacrifice my ego.\nI had to ask for help\na lot of times across many states.\nI had to be adaptable like Carly\nand evolve my skills,\nmy mindset, and my circumstances,\nand then I had to be\nresilient, like Stefano,\nand resurrect myself and my career\nlike a phoenix from the ashes.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\n\nEventually I got an interview.\nAfter 15 years in news and entertainment,\nnine months of unemployment\nand this one interview,\nI had an offer for an entry level job.\nI was 37 years old\nand I was back from the dead.\n\n\n\n11:49\n\n\nWe will all experience\nwhat looks like an ending,\nand we can choose to make it a beginning.\nKind of like Tina, who miraculously\nsurvived that waterfall,\nand because I hate to leave\na cliffhanger hanging,\nTina and Cord did get divorced,\nbut they got remarried three times\nbefore the show went off the air in 2012.\n\n\n\n12:10\n\n\nSo remember,\nas long as there is breath in your body,\nit's never too late to change your story.\n\n\n\n12:18\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:19\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nSpeaking up is hard to do.\nI understood the true meaning\nof this phrase exactly one month ago,\nwhen my wife and I became new parents.\nIt was an amazing moment.\nIt was exhilarating and elating,\nbut it was also scary and terrifying.\nAnd it got particularly terrifying\nwhen we got home from the hospital,\nand we were unsure\nwhether our little baby boy was getting\nenough nutrients from breastfeeding.\nAnd we wanted to call our pediatrician,\nbut we also didn't want\nto make a bad first impression\nor come across as a crazy,\nneurotic parent.\nSo we worried.\nAnd we waited.\nWhen we got to the doctor's office\nthe next day,\nshe immediately gave him formula\nbecause he was pretty dehydrated.\nOur son is fine now,\nand our doctor has reassured us\nwe can always contact her.\nBut in that moment,\nI should've spoken up, but I didn't.\n\n\n\n 1:09\n\n\nBut sometimes we speak up\nwhen we shouldn't,\nand I learned that over 10 years ago\nwhen I let my twin brother down.\nMy twin brother\nis a documentary filmmaker,\nand for one of his first films,\nhe got an offer\nfrom a distribution company.\nHe was excited,\nand he was inclined to accept the offer.\nBut as a negotiations researcher,\nI insisted he make a counteroffer,\nand I helped him craft the perfect one.\nAnd it was perfect —\nit was perfectly insulting.\nThe company was so offended,\nthey literally withdrew the offer\nand my brother was left with nothing.\n\n\n\n 1:47\n\n\nAnd I've asked people all over the world\nabout this dilemma of speaking up:\nwhen they can assert themselves,\nwhen they can push their interests,\nwhen they can express an opinion,\nwhen they can make an ambitious ask.\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nAnd the range of stories\nare varied and diverse,\nbut they also make up\na universal tapestry.\nCan I correct my boss\nwhen they make a mistake?\nCan I confront my coworker\nwho keeps stepping on my toes?\nCan I challenge my friend's\ninsensitive joke?\nCan I tell the person I love the most\nmy deepest insecurities?\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\nAnd through these experiences,\nI've come to recognize\nthat each of us have something called\na range of acceptable behavior.\nNow, sometimes we're too strong;\nwe push ourselves too much.\nThat's what happened with my brother.\nEven making an offer was outside\nhis range of acceptable behavior.\nBut sometimes we're too weak.\nThat's what happened with my wife and I.\nAnd this range of acceptable behaviors —\nwhen we stay within our range,\nwe're rewarded.\nWhen we step outside that range,\nwe get punished in a variety of ways.\nWe get dismissed or demeaned\nor even ostracized.\nOr we lose that raise\nor that promotion or that deal.\n\n\n\n 3:00\n\n\nNow, the first thing we need to know is:\nWhat is my range?\nBut the key thing is,\nour range isn't fixed;\nit's actually pretty dynamic.\nIt expands and it narrows\nbased on the context.\nAnd there's one thing that determines\nthat range more than anything else,\nand that's your power.\nYour power determines your range.\nWhat is power?\nPower comes in lots of forms.\nIn negotiations, it comes\nin the form of alternatives.\nSo my brother had no alternatives;\nhe lacked power.\nThe company had lots of alternatives;\nthey had power.\nSometimes it's being new\nto a country, like an immigrant,\nor new to an organization\nor new to an experience,\nlike my wife and I as new parents.\nSometimes it's at work,\nwhere someone's the boss\nand someone's the subordinate.\nSometimes it's in relationships,\nwhere one person's more invested\nthan the other person.\n\n\n\n 3:54\n\n\nAnd the key thing is that when\nwe have lots of power,\nour range is very wide.\nWe have a lot of leeway in how to behave.\nBut when we lack power, our range narrows.\nWe have very little leeway.\nThe problem is that when\nour range narrows,\nthat produces something called\nthe low-power double bind.\nThe low-power double bind happens\nwhen, if we don't speak up,\nwe go unnoticed,\nbut if we do speak up, we get punished.\n\n\n\n 4:24\n\n\nNow, many of you have heard\nthe phrase the \"double bind\"\nand connected it with one thing,\nand that's gender.\nThe gender double bind is women\nwho don't speak up go unnoticed,\nand women who do speak up get punished.\nAnd the key thing is that women have\nthe same need as men to speak up,\nbut they have barriers to doing so.\nBut what my research has shown\nover the last two decades\nis that what looks\nlike a gender difference\nis not really a gender double bind,\nit's a really a low-power double bind.\nAnd what looks like a gender difference\nare really often just power\ndifferences in disguise.\nOftentimes we see a difference\nbetween a man and a woman\nor men and women,\nand think, \"Biological cause.\nThere's something fundamentally different\nabout the sexes.\"\nBut in study after study,\nI've found that a better explanation\nfor many sex differences\nis really power.\nAnd so it's the low-power double bind.\nAnd the low-power double bind\nmeans that we have a narrow range,\nand we lack power.\nWe have a narrow range,\nand our double bind is very large.\n\n\n\n 5:33\n\n\nSo we need to find ways\nto expand our range.\nAnd over the last couple decades,\nmy colleagues and I have found\ntwo things really matter.\nThe first: you seem powerful\nin your own eyes.\nThe second: you seem powerful\nin the eyes of others.\nWhen I feel powerful,\nI feel confident, not fearful;\nI expand my own range.\nWhen other people see me as powerful,\nthey grant me a wider range.\nSo we need tools to expand\nour range of acceptable behavior.\nAnd I'm going to give you\na set of tools today.\nSpeaking up is risky,\nbut these tools will lower\nyour risk of speaking up.\n\n\n\n 6:14\n\n\nThe first tool I'm going to give you\ngot discovered in negotiations\nin an important finding.\nOn average, women make\nless ambitious offers\nand get worse outcomes than men\nat the bargaining table.\nBut Hannah Riley Bowles\nand Emily Amanatullah have discovered\nthere's one situation\nwhere women get the same outcomes as men\nand are just as ambitious.\nThat's when they advocate for others.\nWhen they advocate for others,\nthey discover their own range\nand expand it in their own mind.\nThey become more assertive.\nThis is sometimes called\n\"the mama bear effect.\"\nLike a mama bear defending her cubs,\nwhen we advocate for others,\nwe can discover our own voice.\n\n\n\n 7:01\n\n\nBut sometimes, we have\nto advocate for ourselves.\nHow do we do that?\nOne of the most important tools\nwe have to advocate for ourselves\nis something called perspective-taking.\nAnd perspective-taking is really simple:\nit's simply looking at the world\nthrough the eyes of another person.\nIt's one of the most important tools\nwe have to expand our range.\nWhen I take your perspective,\nand I think about what you really want,\nyou're more likely to give me\nwhat I really want.\n\n\n\n 7:32\n\n\nBut here's the problem:\nperspective-taking is hard to do.\nSo let's do a little experiment.\nI want you all to hold\nyour hand just like this:\nyour finger — put it up.\nAnd I want you to draw\na capital letter E on your forehead\nas quickly as possible.\nOK, it turns out that we can\ndraw this E in one of two ways,\nand this was originally designed\nas a test of perspective-taking.\nI'm going to show you two pictures\nof someone with an E on their forehead —\nmy former student, Erika Hall.\nAnd you can see over here,\nthat's the correct E.\nI drew the E so it looks like\nan E to another person.\nThat's the perspective-taking E\nbecause it looks like an E\nfrom someone else's vantage point.\nBut this E over here\nis the self-focused E.\nWe often get self-focused.\nAnd we particularly get\nself-focused in a crisis.\n\n\n\n 8:25\n\n\nI want to tell you\nabout a particular crisis.\nA man walks into a bank\nin Watsonville, California.\nAnd he says, \"Give me $2,000,\nor I'm blowing the whole bank\nup with a bomb.\"\nNow, the bank manager\ndidn't give him the money.\nShe took a step back.\nShe took his perspective,\nand she noticed something\nreally important.\nHe asked for a specific amount of money.\n\n\n\n 8:47\n\n\nSo she said,\n\"Why did you ask for $2,000?\"\n\n\n\n 8:52\n\n\nAnd he said, \"My friend\nis going to be evicted\nunless I get him $2,000 immediately.\"\n\n\n\n 8:56\n\n\nAnd she said, \"Oh! You don't want\nto rob the bank —\nyou want to take out a loan.\"\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:02\n\n\n\"Why don't you come back to my office,\nand we can have you\nfill out the paperwork.\"\n\n\n\n 9:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:08\n\n\nNow, her quick perspective-taking\ndefused a volatile situation.\nSo when we take someone's perspective,\nit allows us to be ambitious\nand assertive, but still be likable.\n\n\n\n 9:20\n\n\nHere's another way to be assertive\nbut still be likable,\nand that is to signal flexibility.\nNow, imagine you're a car salesperson,\nand you want to sell someone a car.\nYou're going to more likely make the sale\nif you give them two options.\nLet's say option A:\n$24,000 for this car\nand a five-year warranty.\nOr option B:\n$23,000 and a three-year warranty.\nMy research shows that when you give\npeople a choice among options,\nit lowers their defenses,\nand they're more likely\nto accept your offer.\n\n\n\n 9:53\n\n\nAnd this doesn't just\nwork with salespeople;\nit works with parents.\nWhen my niece was four,\nshe resisted getting dressed\nand rejected everything.\nBut then my sister-in-law\nhad a brilliant idea.\nWhat if I gave my daughter a choice?\nThis shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.\nThis pant or that pant? OK, that pant.\nAnd it worked brilliantly.\nShe got dressed quickly\nand without resistance.\n\n\n\n10:16\n\n\nWhen I've asked the question\naround the world\nwhen people feel comfortable speaking up,\nthe number one answer is:\n\"When I have social support\nin my audience; when I have allies.\"\nSo we want to get allies on our side.\nHow do we do that?\nWell, one of the ways is be a mama bear.\nWhen we advocate for others,\nwe expand our range in our own eyes\nand the eyes of others,\nbut we also earn strong allies.\n\n\n\n10:42\n\n\nAnother way we can earn strong allies,\nespecially in high places,\nis by asking other people for advice.\nWhen we ask others for advice,\nthey like us because we flatter them,\nand we're expressing humility.\nAnd this really works to solve\nanother double bind.\nAnd that's the self-promotion double bind.\nThe self-promotion double bind\nis that if we don't advertise\nour accomplishments,\nno one notices.\nAnd if we do, we're not likable.\n\n\n\n11:12\n\n\nBut if we ask for advice\nabout one of our accomplishments,\nwe are able to be competent\nin their eyes but also be likeable.\nAnd this is so powerful\nit even works when you see it coming.\nThere have been multiple times in life\nwhen I have been forewarned\nthat a low-power person has been given\nthe advice to come ask me for advice.\nI want you to notice\nthree things about this:\nFirst, I knew they were going\nto come ask me for advice.\nTwo, I've actually done research\non the strategic benefits\nof asking for advice.\nAnd three, it still worked!\nI took their perspective,\nI became more invested in their cause,\nI became more committed to them\nbecause they asked for advice.\n\n\n\n11:57\n\n\nNow, another time we feel\nmore confident speaking up\nis when we have expertise.\nExpertise gives us credibility.\nWhen we have high power,\nwe already have credibility.\nWe only need good evidence.\nWhen we lack power,\nwe don't have the credibility.\nWe need excellent evidence.\n\n\n\n12:16\n\n\nAnd one of the ways\nwe can come across as an expert\nis by tapping into our passion.\nI want everyone in the next few days\nto go up to friend of theirs\nand just say to them,\n\"I want you to describe\na passion of yours to me.\"\nI've had people do this all over the world\nand I asked them,\n\"What did you notice\nabout the other person\nwhen they described their passion?\"\nAnd the answers are always the same.\n\"Their eyes lit up and got big.\"\n\"They smiled a big beaming smile.\"\n\"They used their hands all over —\nI had to duck because their\nhands were coming at me.\"\n\"They talk quickly\nwith a little higher pitch.\"\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:54\n\n\n\"They leaned in\nas if telling me a secret.\"\n\n\n\n12:56\n\n\nAnd then I said to them,\n\"What happened to you\nas you listened to their passion?\"\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\nThey said, \"My eyes lit up.\nI smiled.\nI leaned in.\"\n\n\n\n13:06\n\n\nWhen we tap into our passion,\nwe give ourselves the courage,\nin our own eyes, to speak up,\nbut we also get the permission\nfrom others to speak up.\nTapping into our passion even works\nwhen we come across as too weak.\nBoth men and women get punished\nat work when they shed tears.\nBut Lizzie Wolf has shown that when\nwe frame our strong emotions as passion,\nthe condemnation of our crying\ndisappears for both men and women.\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\nI want to end with a few words\nfrom my late father\nthat he spoke at my twin\nbrother's wedding.\nHere's a picture of us.\nMy dad was a psychologist like me,\nbut his real love and his real\npassion was cinema,\nlike my brother.\nAnd so he wrote a speech\nfor my brother's wedding\nabout the roles we play\nin the human comedy.\n\n\n\n14:01\n\n\nAnd he said, \"The lighter your touch,\nthe better you become at improving\nand enriching your performance.\nThose who embrace their roles\nand work to improve their performance\ngrow, change and expand the self.\nPlay it well,\nand your days will be mostly joyful.\"\n\n\n\n14:19\n\n\nWhat my dad was saying\nis that we've all been assigned\nranges and roles in this world.\nBut he was also saying\nthe essence of this talk:\nthose roles and ranges are constantly\nexpanding and evolving.\n\n\n\n14:35\n\n\nSo when a scene calls for it,\nbe a ferocious mama bear\nand a humble advice seeker.\nHave excellent evidence and strong allies.\nBe a passionate perspective taker.\nAnd if you use those tools —\nand each and every one of you\ncan use these tools —\nyou will expand your range\nof acceptable behavior,\nand your days will be mostly joyful.\n\n\n\n15:03\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:04\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhen I was a kid,\nI was the quintessential nerd.\nI think some of you were, too.\n\n\n\n 0:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:19\n\n\nAnd you, sir, who laughed the loudest,\nyou probably still are.\n\n\n\n 0:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:25\n\n\nI grew up in a small town\nin the dusty plains of north Texas,\nthe son of a sheriff\nwho was the son of a pastor.\nGetting into trouble was not an option.\nAnd so I started reading\ncalculus books for fun.\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:39\n\n\nYou did, too.\nThat led me to building a laser\nand a computer and model rockets,\nand that led me to making\nrocket fuel in my bedroom.\nNow, in scientific terms,\nwe call this a very bad idea.\n\n\n\n 0:55\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:57\n\n\nAround that same time,\nStanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"\ncame to the theaters,\nand my life was forever changed.\nI loved everything about that movie,\nespecially the HAL 9000.\nNow, HAL was a sentient computer\ndesigned to guide the Discovery spacecraft\nfrom the Earth to Jupiter.\nHAL was also a flawed character,\nfor in the end he chose\nto value the mission over human life.\nNow, HAL was a fictional character,\nbut nonetheless he speaks to our fears,\nour fears of being subjugated\nby some unfeeling, artificial intelligence\nwho is indifferent to our humanity.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nI believe that such fears are unfounded.\nIndeed, we stand at a remarkable time\nin human history,\nwhere, driven by refusal to accept\nthe limits of our bodies and our minds,\nwe are building machines\nof exquisite, beautiful\ncomplexity and grace\nthat will extend the human experience\nin ways beyond our imagining.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nAfter a career that led me\nfrom the Air Force Academy\nto Space Command to now,\nI became a systems engineer,\nand recently I was drawn\ninto an engineering problem\nassociated with NASA's mission to Mars.\nNow, in space flights to the Moon,\nwe can rely upon\nmission control in Houston\nto watch over all aspects of a flight.\nHowever, Mars is 200 times further away,\nand as a result it takes\non average 13 minutes\nfor a signal to travel\nfrom the Earth to Mars.\nIf there's trouble,\nthere's not enough time.\nAnd so a reasonable engineering solution\ncalls for us to put mission control\ninside the walls of the Orion spacecraft.\nAnother fascinating idea\nin the mission profile\nplaces humanoid robots\non the surface of Mars\nbefore the humans themselves arrive,\nfirst to build facilities\nand later to serve as collaborative\nmembers of the science team.\n\n\n\n 2:54\n\n\nNow, as I looked at this\nfrom an engineering perspective,\nit became very clear to me\nthat what I needed to architect\nwas a smart, collaborative,\nsocially intelligent\nartificial intelligence.\nIn other words, I needed to build\nsomething very much like a HAL\nbut without the homicidal tendencies.\n\n\n\n 3:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:13\n\n\nLet's pause for a moment.\nIs it really possible to build\nan artificial intelligence like that?\nActually, it is.\nIn many ways,\nthis is a hard engineering problem\nwith elements of AI,\nnot some wet hair ball of an AI problem\nthat needs to be engineered.\nTo paraphrase Alan Turing,\nI'm not interested\nin building a sentient machine.\nI'm not building a HAL.\nAll I'm after is a simple brain,\nsomething that offers\nthe illusion of intelligence.\n\n\n\n 3:44\n\n\nThe art and the science of computing\nhave come a long way\nsince HAL was onscreen,\nand I'd imagine if his inventor\nDr. Chandra were here today,\nhe'd have a whole lot of questions for us.\nIs it really possible for us\nto take a system of millions\nupon millions of devices,\nto read in their data streams,\nto predict their failures\nand act in advance?\nYes.\nCan we build systems that converse\nwith humans in natural language?\nYes.\nCan we build systems\nthat recognize objects, identify emotions,\nemote themselves,\nplay games and even read lips?\nYes.\nCan we build a system that sets goals,\nthat carries out plans against those goals\nand learns along the way?\nYes.\nCan we build systems\nthat have a theory of mind?\nThis we are learning to do.\nCan we build systems that have\nan ethical and moral foundation?\nThis we must learn how to do.\nSo let's accept for a moment\nthat it's possible to build\nsuch an artificial intelligence\nfor this kind of mission and others.\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nThe next question\nyou must ask yourself is,\nshould we fear it?\nNow, every new technology\nbrings with it\nsome measure of trepidation.\nWhen we first saw cars,\npeople lamented that we would see\nthe destruction of the family.\nWhen we first saw telephones come in,\npeople were worried it would destroy\nall civil conversation.\nAt a point in time we saw\nthe written word become pervasive,\npeople thought we would lose\nour ability to memorize.\nThese things are all true to a degree,\nbut it's also the case\nthat these technologies\nbrought to us things\nthat extended the human experience\nin some profound ways.\n\n\n\n 5:20\n\n\nSo let's take this a little further.\nI do not fear the creation\nof an AI like this,\nbecause it will eventually\nembody some of our values.\nConsider this: building a cognitive system\nis fundamentally different\nthan building a traditional\nsoftware-intensive system of the past.\nWe don't program them. We teach them.\nIn order to teach a system\nhow to recognize flowers,\nI show it thousands of flowers\nof the kinds I like.\nIn order to teach a system\nhow to play a game —\nWell, I would. You would, too.\nI like flowers. Come on.\nTo teach a system\nhow to play a game like Go,\nI'd have it play thousands of games of Go,\nbut in the process I also teach it\nhow to discern\na good game from a bad game.\nIf I want to create an artificially\nintelligent legal assistant,\nI will teach it some corpus of law\nbut at the same time I am fusing with it\nthe sense of mercy and justice\nthat is part of that law.\nIn scientific terms,\nthis is what we call ground truth,\nand here's the important point:\nin producing these machines,\nwe are therefore teaching them\na sense of our values.\nTo that end, I trust\nan artificial intelligence\nthe same, if not more,\nas a human who is well-trained.\n\n\n\n 6:35\n\n\nBut, you may ask,\nwhat about rogue agents,\nsome well-funded\nnongovernment organization?\nI do not fear an artificial intelligence\nin the hand of a lone wolf.\nClearly, we cannot protect ourselves\nagainst all random acts of violence,\nbut the reality is such a system\nrequires substantial training\nand subtle training\nfar beyond the resources of an individual.\nAnd furthermore,\nit's far more than just injecting\nan internet virus to the world,\nwhere you push a button,\nall of a sudden it's in a million places\nand laptops start blowing up\nall over the place.\nNow, these kinds of substances\nare much larger,\nand we'll certainly see them coming.\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nDo I fear that such\nan artificial intelligence\nmight threaten all of humanity?\nIf you look at movies\nsuch as \"The Matrix,\" \"Metropolis,\"\n\"The Terminator,\"\nshows such as \"Westworld,\"\nthey all speak of this kind of fear.\nIndeed, in the book \"Superintelligence\"\nby the philosopher Nick Bostrom,\nhe picks up on this theme\nand observes that a superintelligence\nmight not only be dangerous,\nit could represent an existential threat\nto all of humanity.\nDr. Bostrom's basic argument\nis that such systems will eventually\nhave such an insatiable\nthirst for information\nthat they will perhaps learn how to learn\nand eventually discover\nthat they may have goals\nthat are contrary to human needs.\nDr. Bostrom has a number of followers.\nHe is supported by people\nsuch as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking.\nWith all due respect\nto these brilliant minds,\nI believe that they\nare fundamentally wrong.\nNow, there are a lot of pieces\nof Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack,\nand I don't have time to unpack them all,\nbut very briefly, consider this:\nsuper knowing is very different\nthan super doing.\nHAL was a threat to the Discovery crew\nonly insofar as HAL commanded\nall aspects of the Discovery.\nSo it would have to be\nwith a superintelligence.\nIt would have to have dominion\nover all of our world.\nThis is the stuff of Skynet\nfrom the movie \"The Terminator\"\nin which we had a superintelligence\nthat commanded human will,\nthat directed every device\nthat was in every corner of the world.\nPractically speaking,\nit ain't gonna happen.\nWe are not building AIs\nthat control the weather,\nthat direct the tides,\nthat command us\ncapricious, chaotic humans.\nAnd furthermore, if such\nan artificial intelligence existed,\nit would have to compete\nwith human economies,\nand thereby compete for resources with us.\nAnd in the end —\ndon't tell Siri this —\nwe can always unplug them.\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:16\n\n\nWe are on an incredible journey\nof coevolution with our machines.\nThe humans we are today\nare not the humans we will be then.\nTo worry now about the rise\nof a superintelligence\nis in many ways a dangerous distraction\nbecause the rise of computing itself\nbrings to us a number\nof human and societal issues\nto which we must now attend.\nHow shall I best organize society\nwhen the need for human labor diminishes?\nHow can I bring understanding\nand education throughout the globe\nand still respect our differences?\nHow might I extend and enhance human life\nthrough cognitive healthcare?\nHow might I use computing\nto help take us to the stars?\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nAnd that's the exciting thing.\nThe opportunities to use computing\nto advance the human experience\nare within our reach,\nhere and now,\nand we are just beginning.\n\n\n\n10:13\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWell, as many of you know,\nthe results of the recent\nelection were as follows:\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate\nwon a landslide victory\nwith 52 percent of the overall vote.\nJill Stein, the Green candidate,\ncame a distant second, with 19 percent.\nDonald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,\nwas hot on her heels with 14 percent,\nand the remainder of the vote\nwere shared between abstainers\nand Gary Johnson,\nthe Libertarian candidate.\n\n\n\n 0:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:46\n\n\nNow, what parallel universe\ndo you suppose I live in?\nWell, I don't live in a parallel universe.\nI live in the world,\nand that is how the world voted.\nSo let me take you back\nand explain what I mean by that.\n\n\n\n 1:01\n\n\nIn June this year,\nI launched something\ncalled the Global Vote.\nAnd the Global Vote\ndoes exactly what it says on the tin.\nFor the first time in history,\nit lets anybody, anywhere in the world,\nvote in the elections\nof other people's countries.\nNow, why would you do that?\nWhat's the point?\nWell, let me show you what it looks like.\nYou go to a website,\nrather a beautiful website,\nand then you select an election.\nHere's a bunch that we've already covered.\nWe do about one a month, or thereabouts.\nSo you can see Bulgaria,\nthe United States of America,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\nthe Brexit referendum at the end there.\nYou select the election\nthat you're interested in,\nand you pick the candidates.\nThese are the candidates\nfrom the recent presidential election\nin the tiny island nation\nof São Tomé and Príncipe,\n199,000 inhabitants,\noff the coast of West Africa.\nAnd then you can look at the brief summary\nof each of those candidates\nwhich I dearly hope is very neutral,\nvery informative and very succinct.\nAnd when you've found\nthe one you like, you vote.\nThese were the candidates\nin the recent Icelandic\npresidential election,\nand that's the way it goes.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nSo why on earth would you want to vote\nin another country's election?\nWell, the reason\nthat you wouldn't want to do it,\nlet me reassure you,\nis in order to interfere in the democratic\nprocesses of another country.\nThat's not the purpose at all.\nIn fact, you can't,\nbecause usually what I do\nis I release the results\nafter the electorate in each\nindividual country has already voted,\nso there's no way that we could\ninterfere in that process.\nBut more importantly,\nI'm not particularly interested\nin the domestic issues\nof individual countries.\nThat's not what we're voting on.\nSo what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton\nproposed to do for the Americans\nis frankly none of our business.\nThat's something that only\nthe Americans can vote on.\n\n\n\n 3:06\n\n\nNo, in the global vote,\nyou're only considering one aspect of it,\nwhich is what are those leaders\ngoing to do for the rest of us?\nAnd that's so very important\nbecause we live,\nas no doubt you're sick\nof hearing people tell you,\nin a globalized, hyperconnected,\nmassively interdependent world\nwhere the political decisions\nof people in other countries\ncan and will have an impact on our lives\nno matter who we are,\nno matter where we live.\nLike the wings of the butterfly\nbeating on one side of the Pacific\nthat can apparently create\na hurricane on the other side,\nso it is with the world\nthat we live in today\nand the world of politics.\nThere is no longer a dividing line between\ndomestic and international affairs.\nAny country, no matter how small,\neven if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,\ncould produce the next Nelson Mandela\nor the next Stalin.\nThey could pollute the atmosphere\nand the oceans, which belong to all of us,\nor they could be responsible\nand they could help all of us.\n\n\n\n 4:08\n\n\nAnd yet, the system is so strange\nbecause the system hasn't caught up\nwith this globalized reality.\nOnly a small number of people\nare allowed to vote for those leaders,\neven though their impact is gigantic\nand almost universal.\nWhat number was it?\n140 million Americans voted\nfor the next president\nof the United States,\nand yet, as all of us knows,\nin a few weeks time,\nsomebody is going to hand over\nthe nuclear launch codes\nto Donald J. Trump.\nNow, if that isn't having\na potential impact on all of us,\nI don't know what is.\nSimilarly, the election\nfor the referendum on the Brexit vote,\na small number of millions\nof British people voted on that,\nbut the outcome of the vote,\nwhichever way it went,\nwould have had a significant impact\non the lives of tens, hundreds of millions\nof people around the world.\nAnd yet, only a tiny number could vote.\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\nWhat kind of democracy is that?\nHuge decisions that affect all of us\nbeing decided by relatively\nvery small numbers of people.\nAnd I don't know about you,\nbut I don't think\nthat sounds very democratic.\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\nSo I'm trying to clear it up.\nBut as I say,\nwe don't ask about domestic questions.\nIn fact, I only ever ask two questions\nof all of the candidates.\nI send them the same\ntwo questions every single time.\nI say, one,\nif you get elected, what are you\ngoing to do for the rest of us,\nfor the remainder of the seven billion\nwho live on this planet?\nSecond question:\nWhat is your vision\nfor your country's future in the world?\nWhat role do you see it playing?\nEvery candidate,\nI send them those questions.\nThey don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.\nI reckon if you're standing\nto become the next president\nof the United States,\nyou're probably pretty tied up\nmost of the time,\nso I'm not altogether surprised\nthat they don't all answer, but many do.\nMore every time.\nAnd some of them do much more than answer.\nSome of them answer in the most\nenthusiastic and most exciting way\nyou could imagine.\n\n\n\n 6:05\n\n\nI just want to say a word here\nfor Saviour Chishimba,\nwho was one of the candidates\nin the recent Zambian\npresidential election.\nHis answers to those two questions\nwere basically an 18-page dissertation\non his view of Zambia's\npotential role in the world\nand in the international community.\nI posted it on the website\nso anybody could read it.\nNow, Saviour won the global vote,\nbut he didn't win the Zambian election.\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\nSo I found myself wondering,\nwhat am I going to do\nwith this extraordinary group of people?\nI've got some wonderful people here\nwho won the global vote.\nWe always get it wrong, by the way.\nThe one that we elect\nis never the person who's elected\nby the domestic electorate.\nThat may be partly because\nwe always seem to go for the woman.\nBut I think it may also be a sign\nthat the domestic electorate\nis still thinking very nationally.\nThey're still thinking very inwardly.\nThey're still asking themselves:\nWhat's in it for me? ...\ninstead of what\nthey should be asking today,\nwhich is, what's in it for we?\n\n\n\n 7:05\n\n\nBut there you go.\nSo suggestions, please, not right now,\nbut send me an email if you've got an idea\nabout what we can do\nwith this amazing team of glorious losers.\n(Laughter)\nWe've got Saviour Chishimba,\nwho I mentioned before.\nWe've got Halla Tómasdóttir,\nwho was the runner up\nin the Icelandic presidential election.\nMany of you may have seen\nher amazing talk at TEDWomen\njust a few weeks ago\nwhere she spoke about the need\nfor more women to get into politics.\nWe've got Maria das Neves\nfrom São Tomé and Príncipe.\nWe've got Hillary Clinton.\nI don't know if she's available.\nWe've got Jill Stein.\nAnd we covered also the election\nfor the next Secretary-General\nof the United Nations.\nWe've got the ex-prime minister\nof New Zealand,\nwho would be a wonderful\nmember of the team.\nSo I think maybe those people,\nthe glorious loser's club,\ncould travel around the world\nwherever there's an election\nand remind people\nof the necessity in our modern age\nof thinking a little bit outwards\nand thinking of\nthe international consequences.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\nSo what comes next for the global vote?\nWell, obviously,\nthe Donald and Hillary show\nis a bit of a difficult one to follow,\nbut there are some other\nreally important elections coming up.\nIn fact, they seem to be multiplying.\nThere's something going on,\nI'm sure you've noticed, in the world.\nAnd the next row of elections\nare all critically important.\nIn just a few day's time\nwe've got the rerun\nof the Austrian presidential election,\nwith the prospect of Norbert Hofer\nbecoming what is commonly described\nas the first far-right head of state\nin Europe since the Second World War.\nNext year we've got Germany,\nwe've got France,\nwe've got presidential elections in Iran\nand a dozen others.\nIt doesn't get less important.\nIt gets more and more important.\n\n\n\n 8:49\n\n\nClearly, the global vote\nis not a stand-alone project.\nIt's not just there on its own.\nIt has some background.\nIt's part of a project\nwhich I launched back in 2014,\nwhich I call the Good Country.\nThe idea of the Good Country\nis basically very simple.\nIt's my simple diagnosis\nof what's wrong with the world\nand how we can fix it.\nWhat's wrong with the world\nI've already hinted at.\nBasically, we face\nan enormous and growing number\nof gigantic, existential\nglobal challenges:\nclimate change, human rights abuses,\nmass migration, terrorism,\neconomic chaos, weapons proliferation.\nAll of these problems\nwhich threaten to wipe us out\nare by their very nature\nglobalized problems.\nNo individual country has the capability\nof tackling them on its own.\n\n\n\n 9:39\n\n\nAnd so very obviously\nwe have to cooperate\nand we have to collaborate as nations\nif we're going to solve these problems.\nIt's so obvious, and yet we don't.\nWe don't do it nearly often enough.\nMost of the time,\ncountries still persist in behaving\nas if they were warring, selfish tribes\nbattling against each other,\nmuch as they have done\nsince the nation-state was invented\nhundreds of years ago.\nAnd this has got to change.\nThis is not a change in political systems\nor a change in ideology.\nThis is a change in culture.\n\n\n\n10:13\n\n\nWe, all of us, have to understand\nthat thinking inwards is not the solution\nto the world's problems.\nWe have to learn how to cooperate\nand collaborate a great deal more\nand compete just a tiny bit less.\nOtherwise things\nare going to carry on getting bad\nand they're going to get much worse,\nmuch sooner than we anticipate.\nThis change will only happen\nif we ordinary people\ntell our politicians\nthat things have changed.\nWe have to tell them\nthat the culture has changed.\nWe have to tell them\nthat they've got a new mandate.\nThe old mandate\nwas very simple and very single:\nif you're in a position\nof power or authority,\nyou're responsible for your own people\nand your own tiny slice of territory,\nand that's it.\nAnd if in order to do\nthe best thing for your own people,\nyou screw over everybody else\non the planet, that's even better.\nThat's considered to be a bit macho.\nToday, I think everybody\nin a position of power and responsibility\nhas got a dual mandate,\nwhich says if you're in a position\nof power and responsibility,\nyou're responsible for your own people\nand for every single man, woman,\nchild and animal on the planet.\nYou're responsible\nfor your own slice of territory\nand for every single square mile\nof the earth's surface\nand the atmosphere above it.\nAnd if you don't like that responsibility,\nyou should not be in power.\nThat for me is the rule of the modern age,\nand that's the message that we've got\nto get across to our politicians,\nand show them that that's the way\nthings are done these days.\nOtherwise, we're all screwed.\n\n\n\n11:41\n\n\nI don't have a problem, actually,\nwith Donald Trump's credo\nof \"America first.\"\nIt seems to me that that's\na pretty banal statement\nof what politicians have always done\nand probably should always do.\nOf course they're elected to represent\nthe interests of their own people.\nBut what I find so boring\nand so old-fashioned\nand so unimaginative\nabout his take on that\nis that America first\nmeans everyone else last,\nthat making America great again\nmeans making everybody else small again,\nand it's just not true.\nIn my job as a policy advisor\nover the last 20 years or so,\nI've seen so many hundreds\nof examples of policies\nthat harmonize the international\nand the domestic needs,\nand they make better policy.\nI'm not asking nations\nto be altruistic or self-sacrificing.\nThat would be ridiculous.\nNo nation would ever do that.\nI'm asking them to wake up and understand\nthat we need a new form of governance,\nwhich is possible\nand which harmonizes those two needs,\nthose good for our own people\nand those good for everybody else.\nSince the US election and since Brexit\nit's become more and more obvious to me\nthat those old distinctions\nof left wing and right wing\nno longer make sense.\nThey really don't fit the pattern.\nWhat does seem to matter today\nis very simple,\nwhether your view of the world is\nthat you take comfort\nfrom looking inwards and backwards,\nor whether, like me, you find hope\nin looking forwards and outwards.\nThat's the new politics.\nThat's the new division that is\nsplitting the world right down the middle.\nNow, that may sound judgmental,\nbut it's not meant to be.\nI don't at all misunderstand\nwhy so many people find their comfort\nin looking inwards and backwards.\nWhen times are difficult,\nwhen you're short of money,\nwhen you're feeling\ninsecure and vulnerable,\nit's almost a natural\nhuman tendency to turn inwards,\nto think of your own needs\nand to discard everybody else's,\nand perhaps to start to imagine\nthat the past was somehow better\nthan the present or the future\ncould ever be.\nBut I happen to believe\nthat that's a dead end.\nHistory shows us that it's a dead end.\nWhen people turn inwards\nand turn backwards,\nhuman progress becomes reversed\nand things get worse for everybody\nvery quickly indeed.\nIf you're like me\nand you believe in forwards and outwards,\nand you believe that the best thing\nabout humanity is its diversity,\nand the best thing about globalization\nis the way that it stirs up\nthat diversity, that cultural mixture\nto make something more creative,\nmore exciting, more productive\nthan there's ever been before\nin human history,\nthen, my friends,\nwe've got a job on our hands,\nbecause the inwards and backwards brigade\nare uniting as never before,\nand that creed of inwards and backwards,\nthat fear, that anxiety,\nplaying on the simplest instincts,\nis sweeping across the world.\nThose of us who believe,\nas I believe, in forwards and outwards,\nwe have to get ourselves organized,\nbecause time is running out\nvery, very quickly.\n\n\n\n14:51\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n14:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

It is.\nIt's an aging movie star,\ngrappling with all\nthe newness around itself,\nwondering whether\nit got it right in the first place,\nand still trying to find a way\nto keep on shining regardless.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nI was born in a refugee colony\nin the capital city of India, New Delhi.\nAnd my father was a freedom fighter.\nMy mother was, well,\njust a fighter like mothers are.\nAnd much like the original homo sapiens,\nwe struggled to survive.\nWhen I was in my early 20s,\nI lost both my parents,\nwhich I must admit\nseems a bit careless of me now,\nbut —\n\n\n\n 2:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:08\n\n\nI do remember the night my father died,\nand I remember the driver of a neighbor\nwho was driving us to the hospital.\nHe mumbled something\nabout \"dead people don't tip so well\"\nand walked away into the dark.\nAnd I was only 14 then,\nand I put my father's dead body\nin the back seat of the car,\nand my mother besides me,\nI started driving back\nfrom the hospital to the house.\nAnd in the middle of her quiet crying,\nmy mother looked at me and she said,\n\"Son, when did you learn to drive?\"\nAnd I thought about it\nand realized, and I said to my mom,\n\"Just now, Mom.\"\n\n\n\n 2:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nSo from that night onwards,\nmuch akin to humanity in its adolescence,\nI learned the crude tools of survival.\nAnd the framework of life was\nvery, very simple then, to be honest.\nYou know, you just ate what you got\nand did whatever you were told to do.\nI thought celiac was a vegetable,\nand vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's\nlost comrade in \"Star Trek.\"\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:09\n\n\nYou married the first girl that you dated,\nand you were a techie if you could fix\nthe carburetor in your car.\nI really thought that gay was\na sophisticated English word for happy.\nAnd Lesbian, of course, was the capital\nof Portugal, as you all know.\n\n\n\n 3:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\nWhere was I?\nWe relied on systems\ncreated through the toil and sacrifice\nof generations before\nto protect us,\nand we felt that governments\nactually worked for our betterment.\nScience was simple and logical,\nApple was still then just a fruit\nowned by Eve first and then Newton,\nnot by Steve Jobs, until then.\nAnd \"Eureka!\" was what you screamed\nwhen you wanted\nto run naked on the streets.\nYou went wherever life took you for work,\nand people were mostly welcoming of you.\nMigration was a term then\nstill reserved for Siberian cranes,\nnot human beings.\nMost importantly, you were who you were\nand you said what you thought.\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nThen in my late 20s,\nI shifted to the sprawling\nmetropolis of Mumbai,\nand my framework,\nlike the newly industrialized\naspirational humanity,\nbegan to alter.\nIn the urban rush for a new,\nmore embellished survival,\nthings started to look a little different.\nI met people who had descended\nfrom all over the world,\nfaces, races, genders, money-lenders.\nDefinitions became more and more fluid.\nWork began to define you at that time\nin an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,\nand all the systems\nstarted to feel less reliable to me,\nalmost too thick to hold on\nto the diversity of mankind\nand the human need to progress and grow.\nIdeas were flowing\nwith more freedom and speed.\nAnd I experienced the miracle\nof human innovation and cooperation,\nand my own creativity,\nwhen supported by the resourcefulness\nof this collective endeavor,\ncatapulted me into superstardom.\n\n\n\n 5:16\n\n\nI started to feel that I had arrived,\nand generally, by the time I was 40,\nI was really, really flying.\nI was all over the place.\nYou know? I'd done 50 films by then\nand 200 songs,\nand I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.\nI had been given the highest civil honor\nby the French government,\nthe title of which for the life of me\nI can't pronounce even until now.\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:37\n\n\nI'm sorry, France, and thank you,\nFrance, for doing that.\nBut much bigger than that,\nI got to meet Angelina Jolie —\n\n\n\n 5:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\nfor two and a half seconds.\n\n\n\n 5:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nAnd I'm sure she also remembers\nthat encounter somewhere.\nOK, maybe not.\nAnd I sat next to Hannah Montana\non a round dinner table\nwith her back towards me most of the time.\nLike I said, I was flying,\nfrom Miley to Jolie,\nand humanity was soaring with me.\nWe were both pretty much\nflying off the handle, actually.\n\n\n\n 6:10\n\n\nAnd then you all know what happened.\nThe internet happened.\nI was in my late 40s,\nand I started tweeting\nlike a canary in a birdcage\nand assuming that, you know,\npeople who peered into my world\nwould admire it\nfor the miracle I believed it to be.\nBut something else\nawaited me and humanity.\nYou know, we had expected\nan expansion of ideas and dreams\nwith the enhanced\nconnectivity of the world.\nWe had not bargained\nfor the village-like enclosure of thought,\nof judgment, of definition\nthat flowed from the same place\nthat freedom and revolution\nwas taking place in.\nEverything I said took a new meaning.\nEverything I did — good, bad, ugly —\nwas there for the world\nto comment upon and judge.\nAs a matter of fact,\neverything I didn't say or do also\nmet with the same fate.\n\n\n\n 7:07\n\n\nFour years ago,\nmy lovely wife Gauri and me\ndecided to have a third child.\nIt was claimed on the net\nthat he was the love child\nof our first child\nwho was 15 years old.\nApparently, he had sown\nhis wild oats with a girl\nwhile driving her car in Romania.\nAnd yeah, there was\na fake video to go with it.\nAnd we were so disturbed as a family.\nMy son, who is 19 now,\neven now when you say \"hello\" to him,\nhe just turns around and says,\n\"But bro, I didn't even have\na European driving license.\"\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nYeah.\nIn this new world,\nslowly, reality became virtual\nand virtual became real,\nand I started to feel\nthat I could not be who I wanted to be\nor say what I actually thought,\nand humanity at this time\ncompletely identified with me.\nI think both of us\nwere going through our midlife crisis,\nand humanity, like me,\nwas becoming an overexposed prima donna.\nI started to sell everything,\nfrom hair oil to diesel generators.\nHumanity was buying everything\nfrom crude oil to nuclear reactors.\nYou know, I even tried\nto get into a skintight superhero suit\nto reinvent myself.\nI must admit I failed miserably.\nAnd just an aside I want to say\non behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men\nand Supermen of the world,\nyou have to commend them,\nbecause it really hurts in the crotch,\nthat superhero suit.\n\n\n\n 8:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:40\n\n\nYeah, I'm being honest.\nI need to tell you this here.\nReally.\nAnd accidentally, I happened\nto even invent a new dance form\nwhich I didn't realize,\nand it became a rage.\nSo if it's all right,\nand you've seen a bit of me,\nso I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.\nIt was called the Lungi dance.\nSo if it's all right, I'll just show you.\nI'm talented otherwise.\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\n(Cheers)\n\n\n\n 9:02\n\n\nSo it went something like this.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi dance.\nLungi dance. Lungi.\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nThat's it. It became a rage.\n\n\n\n 9:14\n\n\n(Cheers)\n\n\n\n 9:15\n\n\nIt really did.\nLike you notice, nobody could make\nany sense of what was happening except me,\nand I didn't give a damn, really,\nbecause the whole world,\nand whole humanity,\nseemed as confused and lost as I was.\nI didn't give up then.\nI even tried to reconstruct\nmy identity on the social media\nlike everyone else does.\nI thought if I put on\nphilosophical tweets out there\npeople will think I'm with it,\nbut some of the responses I got\nfrom those tweets\nwere extremely confusing acronyms\nwhich I didn't understand. You know?\nROFL, LOL.\n\"Adidas,\" somebody wrote back\nto one of my more thought-provoking tweets\nand I was wondering\nwhy would you name a sneaker,\nI mean, why would you write back\nthe name of a sneaker to me?\nAnd I asked my 16-year-old daughter,\nand she enlightened me.\n\"Adidas\" now means\n\"All day I dream about sex.\"\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nReally.\nI didn't know if you know that.\nSo I wrote back,\n\"WTF\" in bold to Mr. Adidas,\nthanking secretly that some acronyms\nand things won't change at all.\nWTF.\n\n\n\n10:21\n\n\nBut here we are.\nI am 51 years old, like I told you,\nand mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,\nI just want to tell you\nif there has been a momentous time\nfor humanity to exist,\nit is now,\nbecause the present you is brave.\nThe present you is hopeful.\nThe present you\nis innovative and resourceful,\nand of course, the present you\nis annoyingly indefinable.\nAnd in this spell-binding,\nimperfect moment of existence,\nfeeling a little brave\njust before I came here,\nI decided to take\na good, hard look at my face.\nAnd I realized that I'm beginning\nto look more and more\nlike the wax statue of me\nat Madame Tussaud's.\n\n\n\n11:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:07\n\n\nYeah, and in that moment of realization,\nI asked the most central\nand pertinent question to humanity and me:\nDo I need to fix my face?\nReally. I'm an actor, like I told you,\na modern expression of human creativity.\nThe land I come from\nis the source of inexplicable\nbut very simple spirituality.\nIn its immense generosity,\nIndia decided somehow\nthat I, the Muslim son\nof a broke freedom fighter\nwho accidentally ventured\ninto the business of selling dreams,\nshould become its king of romance,\nthe \"Badhshah of Bollywood,\"\nthe greatest lover\nthe country has ever seen ...\nwith this face.\nYeah.\n\n\n\n12:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\nWhich has alternately\nbeen described as ugly, unconventional,\nand strangely, not chocolatey enough.\n\n\n\n12:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\nThe people of this ancient land\nembraced me in their limitless love,\nand I've learned from these people\nthat neither power nor poverty\ncan make your life more magical\nor less tortuous.\nI've learned from the people of my country\nthat the dignity of a life,\na human being, a culture,\na religion, a country\nactually resides in its ability\nfor grace and compassion.\nI've learned that whatever moves you,\nwhatever urges you to create, to build,\nwhatever keeps you from failing,\nwhatever helps you survive,\nis perhaps the oldest and the simplest\nemotion known to mankind,\nand that is love.\nA mystic poet from my land famously wrote,\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\n(Recites poem in Hindi)\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\n(Poem ends)\n\n\n\n13:13\n\n\nWhich loosely translates\ninto that whatever —\nyeah, if you know Hindi,\nplease clap, yeah.\n\n\n\n13:18\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:19\n\n\nIt's very difficult to remember.\nWhich loosely translates\ninto actually saying\nthat all the books of knowledge\nthat you might read\nand then go ahead\nand impart your knowledge\nthrough innovation,\nthrough creativity, through technology,\nbut mankind will never be\nthe wiser about its future\nunless it is coupled with a sense of love\nand compassion for their fellow beings.\nThe two and a half alphabets\nwhich form the word \"प्रेम,\"\nwhich means \"love,\"\nif you are able to understand that\nand practice it,\nthat itself is enough\nto enlighten mankind.\nSo I truly believe the future \"you\"\nhas to be a you that loves.\nOtherwise it will cease to flourish.\nIt will perish in its own self-absorption.\n\n\n\n14:09\n\n\nSo you may use your power\nto build walls\nand keep people outside,\nor you may use it to break barriers\nand welcome them in.\nYou may use your faith\nto make people afraid\nand terrify them into submission,\nor you can use it\nto give courage to people\nso they rise to the greatest\nheights of enlightenment.\nYou can use your energy\nto build nuclear bombs\nand spread the darkness of destruction,\nor you can use it to spread\nthe joy of light to millions.\nYou may filthy up the oceans callously\nand cut down all the forests.\nYou can destroy the ecology,\nor turn to them with love\nand regenerate life\nfrom the waters and trees.\nYou may land on Mars\nand build armed citadels,\nor you may look for life-forms and species\nto learn from and respect.\nAnd you can use\nall the moneys we all have earned\nto wage futile wars\nand give guns in the hands\nof little children\nto kill each other with,\nor you can use it\nto make more food\nto fill their stomachs with.\n\n\n\n15:25\n\n\nMy country has taught me\nthe capacity for a human being to love\nis akin to godliness.\nIt shines forth in a world\nwhich civilization, I think,\nalready has tampered too much with.\nIn the last few days,\nthe talks here, the wonderful people\ncoming and showing their talent,\ntalking about individual achievements,\nthe innovation, the technology,\nthe sciences, the knowledge\nwe are gaining by being here\nin the presence of TED Talks\nand all of you\nare reasons enough\nfor us to celebrate the future \"us.\"\nBut within that celebration\nthe quest to cultivate\nour capacity for love and compassion\nhas to assert itself,\nhas to assert itself,\njust as equally.\n\n\n\n16:14\n\n\nSo I believe the future \"you\"\nis an infinite you.\nIt's called a chakra\nin India, like a circle.\nIt ends where it begins from\nto complete itself.\nA you that perceives\ntime and space differently\nunderstands both\nyour unimaginable\nand fantastic importance\nand your complete unimportance\nin the larger context of the universe.\nA you that returns back\nto the original innocence of humanity,\nwhich loves from the purity of heart,\nwhich sees from the eyes of truth,\nwhich dreams from the clarity\nof an untampered mind.\n\n\n\n17:07\n\n\nThe future \"you\" has to be\nlike an aging movie star\nwho has been made to believe\nthat there is a possibility\nof a world which is completely,\nwholly, self-obsessively\nin love with itself.\nA world — really, it has to be a you\nto create a world\nwhich is its own best lover.\nThat I believe, ladies and gentlemen,\nshould be the future \"you.\"\n\n\n\n17:34\n\n\nThank you very much.\nShukriya.\n\n\n\n17:37\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:39\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n17:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:43\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n17:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nSo, I have an overlooked\nbut potentially lucrative\ninvestment opportunity for you.\nOver the past 10 years in the UK,\nthe return on burial plots\nhas outperformed the UK property market\nby a ratio of around three to one.\nThere are private cemeteries being set up\nwith plots for sale to investors,\nand they start at around 3,900 pounds.\nAnd they're projected to achieve\nabout 40 percent growth.\nThe biggest advantage is that this\nis a market with continuous demand.\n\n\n\n 0:46\n\n\nNow, this is a real proposition,\nand there are companies out there\nthat really are offering this investment,\nbut my interest in it is quite different.\nI'm an architect and urban designer,\nand for the past year and a half,\nI've been looking at approaches\nto death and dying\nand at how they've shaped our cities\nand the buildings within them.\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nSo in the summer,\nI did my first exhibition\non death and architecture in Venice,\nand it was called \"Death in Venice.\"\nAnd because death is a subject\nthat many of us find quite\nuncomfortable to talk about,\nthe exhibition was designed\nto be quite playful,\nso that people would\nliterally engage with it.\nSo one of our exhibits\nwas an interactive map of London\nwhich showed just how much\nof the real estate in the city\nis given over to death.\nAs you wave your hand across the map,\nthe name of the piece of real estate —\nthe building or the cemetery —\nis revealed.\nAnd those white shapes that you can see,\nthey're all of the hospitals and hospices\nand mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.\nIn fact, the majority are cemeteries.\nWe wanted to show that, even though\ndeath and burial are things\nthat we might not think about,\nthey're all around us, and they're\nimportant parts of our cities.\n\n\n\n 2:03\n\n\nSo about half a million people\ndie in the UK each year,\nand of those, around a quarter\nwill want to be buried.\nBut the UK, like many\nWestern European countries,\nis running out of burial space,\nespecially in the major cities.\nAnd the Greater London Authority\nhas been aware of this for a while,\nand the main causes are population growth,\nthe fact that existing\ncemeteries are almost full.\nThere's a custom in the UK that graves\nare considered to be occupied forever,\nand there's also development pressure —\npeople want to use that same land\nto build houses or offices or shops.\n\n\n\n 2:40\n\n\nSo they came up with a few solutions.\nThey were like, well, maybe we can\nreuse those graves after 50 years.\nOr maybe we can bury people,\nlike, four deep,\nso that four people can be buried\nin the same plot,\nand we can make more efficient use\nof the land that way,\nand in that way, hopefully London\nwill still have space to bury people\nin the near future.\n\n\n\n 3:00\n\n\nBut, traditionally, cemeteries\nhaven't been taken care of\nby the local authority.\nIn fact, the surprising thing is that\nthere's no legal obligation\non anyone in the UK\nto provide burial space.\nTraditionally, it's been done\nby private and religious organizations,\nlike churches and mosques and synagogues.\nBut there's also occasionally\nbeen a for-profit group\nwho has wanted to get in on the act.\nAnd, you know, they look at\nthe small size of a burial plot\nand that high cost,\nand it looks like there's\nserious money to be made.\n\n\n\n 3:33\n\n\nSo, actually, if you want to go out\nand start your own cemetery,\nyou kind of can.\nThere was this couple in South Wales,\nand they had a farmhouse\nand a load of fields next to it,\nand they wanted to develop the land.\nThey had a load of ideas.\nThey first thought about making\na caravan park,\nbut the council said no.\nAnd then they wanted to make a fish farm\nand again the council said no.\nThen they hit on the idea\nof making a cemetery\nand they calculated that by doing this,\nthey could increase\nthe value of their land\nfrom about 95,000 pounds\nto over one million pounds.\n\n\n\n 4:09\n\n\nBut just to come back to this idea\nof making profit from cemeteries,\nlike, it's kind of ludicrous, right?\nThe thing is that the high cost\nof those burial plots\nis actually very misleading.\nThey look like they're expensive,\nbut that cost reflects the fact that\nyou need to maintain the burial plot —\nlike, someone has to cut the grass\nfor the next 50 years.\nThat means it's very difficult\nto make money from cemeteries.\nAnd it's the reason that normally\nthey're run by the council\nor by a not-for-profit group.\nBut anyway, the council granted\nthese people permission,\nand they're now trying\nto build their cemetery.\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\nSo just to explain to you\nkind of how this works:\nIf I want to build something in the UK,\nlike a cemetery for example,\nthen I have to apply\nfor planning permission first.\nSo if I want to build a new\noffice building for a client\nor if I want to extend my home\nor, you know, if I have a shop\nand I want to convert it into an office,\nI have to do a load of drawings,\nand I submit them\nto the council for permission.\nAnd they'll look at things like\nhow it fits in the surroundings.\nSo they'll look at what it looks like.\nBut they'll also think about things\nlike what impact is it going to have\non the local environment?\nAnd they'll be thinking about things like,\nis this thing going to cause pollution\nor is there going to be a lot of traffic\nthat wants to go to this thing\nthat I've built?\nBut also good things.\nIs it going to add local services\nlike shops to the neighborhood\nthat local people would like to use?\nAnd they'll weigh up the advantages\nand the disadvantages\nand they'll make a decision.\n\n\n\n 5:41\n\n\nSo that's how it works if I want\nto build a large cemetery.\nBut what if I've got a piece of land\nand I just want to bury\na few people, like five or six?\nWell, then — actually, I don't need\npermission from anyone!\nThere's actually almost no regulation\nin the UK around burial,\nand the little bit that there is,\nis about not polluting water courses,\nlike not polluting rivers or groundwater.\nSo actually, if you want to go\nand make your own mini-cemetery,\nthen you can.\n\n\n\n 6:12\n\n\nBut I mean, like — really,\nwho does this? Right?\nWell, if you're an aristocratic family\nand you have a large estate,\nthen there's a chance that you'll\nhave a mausoleum on it,\nand you'll bury your family there.\nBut the really weird thing\nis that you don't need to have\na piece of land of a certain size\nbefore you're allowed\nto start burying people on it.\nAnd so that means that, technically,\nthis applies to, like, the back garden\nof your house in the suburbs.\n\n\n\n 6:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:41\n\n\nSo what if you wanted\nto try this yourself at home?\nWell, there's a few councils\nthat have guidance on their website\nwhich can help you.\n\n\n\n 6:50\n\n\nSo, the first thing that they tell you\nis that you need to have a certificate\nof burial before you can go ahead —\nyou're not allowed to just murder people\nand put them under the patio.\n\n\n\n 7:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:03\n\n\nThey also tell you that you need to keep\na record of where the grave is.\nBut that's pretty much it\nfor formal requirements.\nNow, they do warn you that\nyour neighbors might not like this,\nbut, legally speaking, there's almost\nnothing that they can do about it.\nAnd just in case any of you\nstill had that profit idea in your mind\nabout how much those burial plots cost\nand how much money\nyou might be able to make,\nthey also warn that it might cause\nthe value of your house\nto drop by 20 percent.\nAlthough, actually, it's more likely\nthat no one will want to buy\nyour house at all after that.\n\n\n\n 7:37\n\n\nSo what I find fascinating about this\nis the fact that it kind of sums up\nmany of our attitudes towards death.\nIn the UK, and I think that the figures\nacross Europe are probably similar,\nonly about 30 percent of people\nhave ever talked to anyone\nabout their wishes around death,\nand even for people over 75,\nonly 45 percent of people\nhave ever talked about this.\nAnd the reasons that\npeople give ... you know,\nthey think that their death is far off\nor they think that they're going\nto make people uncomfortable\nby talking about it.\nAnd you know, to a certain extent,\nthere are other people out there\nwho are taking care of things for us.\nThe government has all this regulation\nand bureaucracy around things\nlike burying a death, for example,\nand there's people like funeral directors\nwho devote their entire\nworking lives to this issue.\nBut when it comes to our cities\nand thinking about how\ndeath fits in our cities,\nthere's much less regulation\nand design and thought\nthan we might imagine.\n\n\n\n 8:35\n\n\nSo we're not thinking about this,\nbut all of the people we imagine\nare thinking about it —\nthey're not taking care of it either.\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 8:43\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nEight years ago, I was haunted\nby an evil spirit.\n\n\n\n 0:19\n\n\nI was 25 at the time,\nand I was living in a tiny house\nbehind someone else's house\nin Los Angeles.\nIt was this guest house,\nit had kind of been dilapidated,\nnot taken care of for a long time.\nAnd one night, I was sitting there\nand I got this really spooky feeling,\nkind of the feeling\nlike you're being watched.\nBut no one was there except my two dogs,\nand they were just chewing their feet.\nAnd I looked around. No one was there.\nAnd I thought, OK,\nit's just my imagination.\nBut the feeling just kept getting worse,\nand I started to feel\nthis pressure in my chest,\nsort of like the feeling\nwhen you get bad news.\nBut it started to sink lower and lower\nand almost hurt.\n\n\n\n 1:15\n\n\nAnd over the course of that week,\nthis feeling got worse and worse,\nand I started to become convinced\nthat something was there\nin my little guest house, haunting me.\n\n\n\n 1:29\n\n\nAnd I started to hear these sounds,\nthis \"whoosh,\" kind of whisper,\nlike something passing through me.\nI called my best friend, Claire, and said,\n\"I know this is going to sound crazy,\nbut, um ...\nI think there's a ghost in my house,\nand I need to get rid of it.\"\nAnd she said — she's very\nopen-minded — and she said,\n\"I don't think you're crazy.\nI think you just need\nto do a cleansing ritual.\"\n\n\n\n 2:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:06\n\n\n\"So get some sage and burn it,\nand tell it to go away.\"\n\n\n\n 2:14\n\n\nSo I said, \"OK,\"\nand I went and I bought sage.\nI had never done this before,\nso I set the sage on fire,\nwaved it about, and said, \"Go away!\nThis is my house! I live here.\nYou don't live here!\"\nBut the feeling stayed.\nNothing got better.\nAnd then I started to think,\nOK, well now this thing is probably\njust laughing at me,\nbecause it hasn't left,\nand I probably just look like\nthis impotent, powerless thing\nthat couldn't get it to go away.\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nSo every day I'd come home\nand you guys, this feeling got so bad\nthat — I mean, I'm laughing at it now —\nbut I would sit there in bed\nand cry every night.\nAnd the feeling on my chest\ngot worse and worse.\nIt was physically painful.\nAnd I even went to a psychiatrist\nand tried to get her\nto prescribe me medicine,\nand she wouldn't just because\nI don't have schizophrenia, OK.\n\n\n\n 3:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\nSo finally I got on the internet,\nand I Googled \"hauntings.\"\nAnd I came upon this forum\nof ghost hunters.\nBut these were a special\nkind of ghost hunters —\nthey were skeptics.\nThey believed that every case of ghosts\nthat they had investigated so far\nhad been explained away by science.\nAnd I was like, \"OK, smart guys,\nthis is what's happening to me,\nand if you have an explanation for me,\nI would love to hear it.\"\n\n\n\n 3:54\n\n\nAnd one of them said, \"OK.\nUm, have you heard\nof carbon monoxide poisoning?\"\n\n\n\n 4:03\n\n\nAnd I said, \"Yeah.\nLike, gas poisoning?\"\n\n\n\n 4:11\n\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\nis when you have a gas leak\nleaking into your home.\nI looked it up, and the symptoms\nof carbon monoxide poisoning\ninclude a pressure on your chest,\nauditory hallucinations — whoosh —\nand an unexplained feeling of dread.\nSo that night, I called the gas company.\nI said, \"I have an emergency.\nI need you to come out.\nI don't want to get into the story now,\nbut I need you to come out.\"\n\n\n\n 4:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\nThey came out. I said,\n\"I suspect a gas leak.\"\nThey brought their carbon\nmonoxide detector,\nand the man said,\n\"It's a really good thing\nthat you called us tonight,\nbecause you could have been\ndead very soon.\"\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\nThirty-seven percent of Americans\nbelieve in haunted houses,\nand I wonder how many of them\nhave been in one\nand how many of them have been in danger.\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\nSo that haunting story\nhas led me to my job.\nI'm an investigator, and I'm\nan investigator in two senses:\nI'm an investigative journalist,\nand I'm also an investigator\nof the claims of the paranormal\nand claims of the spiritual.\nAnd that means a few things.\nSometimes that means that I'm pretending\nto need an exorcism\nso I can get — yes, that's right! —\nso I can go to an exorcist\nand see if he's using gimmicks\nor psychological tricks\nto try to convince someone\nthat they're possessed.\nSometimes that means\nI'm going undercover in a fringe group\nwhich I report on\nfor a podcast that I co-host.\nAnd I've done over 70 investigations\nlike this with my co-host, Ross.\nI would love to tell you\nthat nine times out of 10, science wins,\nsaves the day, it's all explained.\nThat's not true.\nThe truth is, 10 times out of 10,\nscience wins, it saves the day.\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:26\n\n\nAnd that doesn't mean\nthere's no such thing as a mystery.\nOf course there are mysteries,\nbut a mystery is a mystery.\nIt is not a ghost.\n\n\n\n 6:35\n\n\nNow, I believe there are\ntwo kinds of truth,\nand it's taken me a while to get\nto this place, but I think this is right,\nso hear me out.\nI think there is outer truth\nand there's inner truth.\nSo if you say to me,\n\"There was a man named Jesus\nand he once existed,\"\nthat's outer truth, right?\nAnd we can go and look\nat the historical record.\nWe can determine\nwhether that seems to be true.\nAnd I would argue,\nit does seem to be true.\nIf you say, \"Jesus rose\nfrom the dead,\" — ooh, trickier.\n\n\n\n 7:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:11\n\n\nI would say that's an outer-truth claim,\nbecause he physically rose or he didn't.\nI'm not going to get into\nwhether he rose or he didn't,\nbut I would say\nthat's an outer-truth claim.\nIt happened or it didn't happen.\nBut if you say, \"I don't care\nwhether he rose from the dead.\nIt's symbolically important to me,\nand that metaphor is so meaningful,\nso purposeful to me,\nand I'm not going to try\nto persuade you of it,\"\nnow you've moved it\nfrom outer truth to inner truth,\nfrom science to art.\nAnd I think we have a tendency\nto not be clear about this,\nto try to move our inner truths\nto outer truths,\nor to not be fair about it to each other,\nand when people are telling us\ntheir inner truths,\nto try to make them defend them\nby outer-truth standards.\n\n\n\n 7:58\n\n\nSo I'm talking here about outer truth,\nabout objective things.\nAnd there was an objective reality\nin my haunted house, right?\nNow that I've told you about the gas leak,\nI doubt a single person here\nwould be like,\n\"I still think there was a ghost, too\" —\n\n\n\n 8:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:15\n\n\nbecause as soon as we have\nthese scientific explanations,\nwe know to give up the ghost.\nWe use these things as stopgaps\nfor things that we can't explain.\nWe don't believe them because of evidence;\nwe believe them because\nof a lack of evidence.\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\nSo there is a group in Los Angeles\ncalled the Independent\nInvestigations Group, or the IIG,\nand they do great work.\nThey'll give a $10,000 prize\nto anyone who can show,\nunder scientific conditions,\nthat they have a paranormal ability.\nNo one's done it yet,\nbut they've had a couple people\nwho claim that they were clairaudients,\nwhich means that they can hear voices\neither from the great beyond\nor they can read minds.\nAnd they had one person\nwho was very sincere,\nwho believed that he could read minds.\nSo they set up a test with him,\nand this is the way it always works.\nThe group says, \"OK, we have a protocol,\nwe have a way to scientifically test this.\nDo you agree with it?\"\nThe person says yes. Then they test it.\nIt's very important that both sides agree.\nThey did that, they tested him.\nThey said, \"OK, you know what?\nYou weren't able to predict\nwhat Lisa was thinking.\nIt matched up about the same as chance.\nLooks like you don't have the power.\"\n\n\n\n 9:33\n\n\nAnd that gave them the opportunity\nto compassionately sit down with him\nand have a very difficult discussion,\nwhich basically amounted to,\n\"Hey, we know you're sincere,\nand what that means is,\nyou do hear something in your head.\"\n\n\n\n 9:50\n\n\nAnd that guy got to make\nthe very difficult decision,\nbut really the life-changing decision\nabout whether to go get help.\nWe're actually helping people\nto make these connections\nthat maybe before seemed like\notherworldly explanations,\nhelp draw us into reality\nand maybe change our lives for the better.\n\n\n\n10:17\n\n\nNow, on the other hand,\nmaybe one time it'll turn out to be true.\nMaybe we'll find out there are ghosts,\nand holy shit, it will be the best thing!\nAnd every time I do\none of these investigations,\nI still get so excited,\nand I'm like 75 into them,\nand still I swear on number 76,\nI'm going to be like, \"This is the one!\"\n\n\n\n10:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:40\n\n\nMaybe I'm just eternally optimistic,\nbut I hope I never lose this hope,\nand I invite you to take\nthis same attitude\nwhen people share\ntheir outer beliefs with you.\nWhen talking about testable claims,\nrespect them enough to ask\nthese good questions.\nChallenge and see\nhow you can examine them together,\nbecause there's this idea\nthat you can't respect a belief\nand still challenge it,\nbut that's not true.\nWhen we jiggle the lock,\nwhen we test the claim,\nwe're saying, OK, I respect you,\nI'm listening to what you're saying,\nI'm going to test it out with you.\nWe've all had that experience\nwhere you're telling someone something,\nand they're like, \"Oh,\nthat's really interesting, yeah,\"\nyou know you're being had.\nBut when someone says, \"Really? Huh.\nSounds a little sketchy to me,\nbut I'm listening,\"\nyou at least know\nyou're being engaged and respected.\nAnd that's the kind of attitude\nwe should have with these claims.\nThat's showing someone\nthat you care what they're saying.\nThat's respect.\n\n\n\n11:45\n\n\nNow, yes, most of these searches\nwill come up empty,\nbut that's how all of science works.\nEvery cure for cancer so far\nhas not panned out,\nbut we don't stop looking,\nfor two reasons.\nBecause number one, the answer matters.\nWhether it's looking at the afterlife\nor the paranormal or the cure for cancer,\nit all amounts to the same question:\nHow long will we be here?\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\nAnd two, because looking for the truth,\nbeing open-minded,\nand being willing to be wrong\nand to change your whole worldview\nis awe-inspiring.\n\n\n\n12:25\n\n\nI still get excited at ghost stories\nevery single time.\nI still consider that every group\nI join might be right,\nand I hope I never lose that hope.\nLet's all never lose that hope,\nbecause searching for what's out there\nhelps us understand what's in here.\nAnd also, please have\na carbon monoxide detector in your home.\n\n\n\n12:49\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:50\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nA few days after my husband Paul\nwas diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,\nwe were lying in our bed at home,\nand Paul said,\n\"It's going to be OK.\"\nAnd I remember answering back,\n\"Yes.\nWe just don't know what OK means yet.\"\n\n\n\n 0:34\n\n\nPaul and I had met as first-year\nmedical students at Yale.\nHe was smart and kind and super funny.\nHe used to keep a gorilla suit\nin the trunk of his car,\nand he'd say, \"It's for emergencies only.\"\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nI fell in love with Paul as I watched\nthe care he took with his patients.\nHe stayed late talking with them,\nseeking to understand\nthe experience of illness\nand not just its technicalities.\nHe later told me he fell in love with me\nwhen he saw me cry over an EKG\nof a heart that had ceased beating.\nWe didn't know it yet,\nbut even in the heady days of young love,\nwe were learning how\nto approach suffering together.\n\n\n\n 1:21\n\n\nWe got married and became doctors.\nI was working as an internist\nand Paul was finishing his training\nas a neurosurgeon\nwhen he started to lose weight.\nHe developed excruciating back pain\nand a cough that wouldn't go away.\nAnd when he was admitted to the hospital,\na CT scan revealed tumors\nin Paul's lungs and in his bones.\nWe had both cared for patients\nwith devastating diagnoses;\nnow it was our turn.\n\n\n\n 1:57\n\n\nWe lived with Paul's illness\nfor 22 months.\nHe wrote a memoir about facing mortality.\nI gave birth to our daughter Cady,\nand we loved her and each other.\nWe learned directly how to struggle\nthrough really tough medical decisions.\nThe day we took Paul\ninto the hospital for the last time\nwas the most difficult day of my life.\nWhen he turned to me at the end\nand said, \"I'm ready,\"\nI knew that wasn't just a brave decision.\nIt was the right one.\nPaul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.\nIn that moment,\nthe most important thing to Paul\nwas to hold our baby daughter.\nNine hours later,\nPaul died.\n\n\n\n 2:54\n\n\nI've always thought of myself\nas a caregiver —\nmost physicians do —\nand taking care of Paul\ndeepened what that meant.\nWatching him reshape\nhis identity during his illness,\nlearning to witness and accept his pain,\ntalking together through his choices —\nthose experiences taught me\nthat resilience does not mean\nbouncing back to where you were before,\nor pretending that\nthe hard stuff isn't hard.\nIt is so hard.\nIt's painful, messy stuff.\nBut it's the stuff.\nAnd I learned that when we\napproach it together,\nwe get to decide what success looks like.\n\n\n\n 3:42\n\n\nOne of the first things\nPaul said to me after his diagnosis was,\n\"I want you to get remarried.\"\nAnd I was like, whoa, I guess\nwe get to say anything out loud.\n\n\n\n 3:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:55\n\n\nIt was so shocking\nand heartbreaking ...\nand generous,\nand really comforting\nbecause it was so starkly honest,\nand that honesty turned out\nto be exactly what we needed.\nEarly in Paul's illness,\nwe agreed we would\njust keep saying things out loud.\nTasks like making a will,\nor completing our advance directives —\ntasks that I had always avoided —\nwere not as daunting as they once seemed.\nI realized that completing\nan advance directive is an act of love —\nlike a wedding vow.\nA pact to take care of someone,\ncodifying the promise\nthat til death do us part,\nI will be there.\nIf needed, I will speak for you.\nI will honor your wishes.\nThat paperwork became\na tangible part of our love story.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\nAs physicians,\nPaul and I were in a good position\nto understand and even\naccept his diagnosis.\nWe weren't angry about it,\nluckily,\nbecause we'd seen so many patients\nin devastating situations,\nand we knew that death is a part of life.\nBut it's one thing to know that;\nit was a very different experience\nto actually live with the sadness\nand uncertainty of a serious illness.\nHuge strides are being made\nagainst lung cancer,\nbut we knew that Paul likely had\nmonths to a few years left to live.\n\n\n\n 5:35\n\n\nDuring that time,\nPaul wrote about his transition\nfrom doctor to patient.\nHe talked about feeling\nlike he was suddenly at a crossroads,\nand how he would have thought\nhe'd be able to see the path,\nthat because he treated so many patients,\nmaybe he could follow in their footsteps.\nBut he was totally disoriented.\nRather than a path,\nPaul wrote,\n\"I saw instead\nonly a harsh, vacant,\ngleaming white desert.\nAs if a sandstorm\nhad erased all familiarity.\nI had to face my mortality\nand try to understand\nwhat made my life worth living,\nand I needed my oncologist's\nhelp to do so.\"\n\n\n\n 6:26\n\n\nThe clinicians taking care of Paul\ngave me an even deeper appreciation\nfor my colleagues in health care.\nWe have a tough job.\nWe're responsible for helping patients\nhave clarity around their prognoses\nand their treatment options,\nand that's never easy,\nbut it's especially tough\nwhen you're dealing with potentially\nterminal illnesses like cancer.\nSome people don't want to know\nhow long they have left,\nothers do.\nEither way, we never have those answers.\nSometimes we substitute hope\nby emphasizing the best-case scenario.\nIn a survey of physicians,\n55 percent said\nthey painted a rosier picture\nthan their honest opinion\nwhen describing a patient's prognosis.\nIt's an instinct born out of kindness.\nBut researchers have found\nthat when people better understand\nthe possible outcomes of an illness,\nthey have less anxiety,\ngreater ability to plan\nand less trauma for their families.\n\n\n\n 7:39\n\n\nFamilies can struggle\nwith those conversations,\nbut for us, we also found that information\nimmensely helpful with big decisions.\nMost notably,\nwhether to have a baby.\nMonths to a few years meant\nPaul was not likely to see her grow up.\nBut he had a good chance\nof being there for her birth\nand for the beginning of her life.\nI remember asking Paul\nif he thought having\nto say goodbye to a child\nwould make dying even more painful.\nAnd his answer astounded me.\nHe said,\n\"Wouldn't it be great if it did?\"\nAnd we did it.\nNot in order to spite cancer,\nbut because we were learning\nthat living fully\nmeans accepting suffering.\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\nPaul's oncologist tailored his chemo\nso he could continue\nworking as a neurosurgeon,\nwhich initially we thought\nwas totally impossible.\nWhen the cancer advanced\nand Paul shifted from surgery to writing,\nhis palliative care doctor\nprescribed a stimulant medication\nso he could be more focused.\nThey asked Paul about\nhis priorities and his worries.\nThey asked him what trade-offs\nhe was willing to make.\nThose conversations\nare the best way to ensure\nthat your health care matches your values.\nPaul joked that it's not\nlike that \"birds and bees\" talk\nyou have with your parents,\nwhere you all get it over with\nas quickly as possible,\nand then pretend it never happened.\nYou revisit the conversation\nas things change.\nYou keep saying things out loud.\nI'm forever grateful\nbecause Paul's clinicians felt\nthat their job wasn't to try\nto give us answers they didn't have,\nor only to try to fix things for us,\nbut to counsel Paul\nthrough painful choices ...\nwhen his body was failing\nbut his will to live wasn't.\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nLater, after Paul died,\nI received a dozen bouquets of flowers,\nbut I sent just one ...\nto Paul's oncologist,\nbecause she supported his goals\nand she helped him weigh his choices.\nShe knew that living\nmeans more than just staying alive.\n\n\n\n10:24\n\n\nA few weeks ago,\na patient came into my clinic.\nA woman dealing\nwith a serious chronic disease.\nAnd while we were talking\nabout her life and her health care,\nshe said, \"I love my palliative care team.\nThey taught me that it's OK to say 'no'.\"\nYeah, I thought, of course it is.\nBut many patients don't feel that.\nCompassion and Choices did a study\nwhere they asked people\nabout their health care preferences.\nAnd a lot of people\nstarted their answers with the words\n\"Well, if I had a choice ...\"\nIf I had a choice.\nAnd when I read that \"if,\"\nI understood better\nwhy one in four people\nreceives excessive or unwanted\nmedical treatment,\nor watches a family member receive\nexcessive or unwanted medical treatment.\nIt's not because doctors don't get it.\nWe do.\nWe understand the real\npsychological consequences\non patients and their families.\nThe things is, we deal with them, too.\nHalf of critical care nurses\nand a quarter of ICU doctors\nhave considered quitting their jobs\nbecause of distress over feeling\nthat for some of their patients,\nthey've provided care\nthat didn't fit with the person's values.\nBut doctors can't make sure\nyour wishes are respected\nuntil they know what they are.\n\n\n\n12:03\n\n\nWould you want to be on life support\nif it offered any chance of longer life?\nAre you most worried\nabout the quality of that time,\nrather than quantity?\nBoth of those choices\nare thoughtful and brave,\nbut for all of us, it's our choice.\nThat's true at the end of life\nand for medical care throughout our lives.\nIf you're pregnant,\ndo you want genetic screening?\nIs a knee replacement right or not?\nDo you want to do dialysis\nin a clinic or at home?\nThe answer is:\nit depends.\nWhat medical care will help you\nlive the way you want to?\nI hope you remember that question\nthe next time you face\na decision in your health care.\nRemember that you always have a choice,\nand it is OK to say no to a treatment\nthat's not right for you.\n\n\n\n13:05\n\n\nThere's a poem by W.S. Merwin —\nit's just two sentences long —\nthat captures how I feel now.\n\"Your absence has gone through me\nlike thread through a needle.\nEverything I do\nis stitched with its color.\"\nFor me that poem evokes my love for Paul,\nand a new fortitude\nthat came from loving and losing him.\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\nWhen Paul said, \"It's going to be OK,\"\nthat didn't mean\nthat we could cure his illness.\nInstead, we learned to accept\nboth joy and sadness at the same time;\nto uncover beauty and purpose\nboth despite and because we are all born\nand we all die.\nAnd for all the sadness\nand sleepless nights,\nit turns out there is joy.\nI leave flowers on Paul's grave\nand watch our two-year-old\nrun around on the grass.\nI build bonfires on the beach\nand watch the sunset with our friends.\nExercise and mindfulness\nmeditation have helped a lot.\nAnd someday,\nI hope I do get remarried.\n\n\n\n14:35\n\n\nMost importantly,\nI get to watch our daughter grow.\nI've thought a lot\nabout what I'm going to say to her\nwhen she's older.\n\"Cady,\nengaging in the full\nrange of experience —\nliving and dying,\nlove and loss —\nis what we get to do.\nBeing human doesn't happen\ndespite suffering.\nIt happens within it.\nWhen we approach suffering together,\nwhen we choose not to hide from it,\nour lives don't diminish,\nthey expand.\"\n\n\n\n15:20\n\n\nI've learned that cancer\nisn't always a battle.\nOr if it is,\nmaybe it's a fight for something\ndifferent than we thought.\nOur job isn't to fight fate,\nbut to help each other through.\nNot as soldiers\nbut as shepherds.\nThat's how we make it OK,\neven when it's not.\nBy saying it out loud,\nby helping each other through ...\nand a gorilla suit never hurts, either.\n\n\n\n15:59\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI want to introduce you to some\nvery wise kids that I've known,\nbut first I want\nto introduce you to a camel.\nThis is Cassie, a therapy camel\nvisiting one of our young patients\nin her room,\nwhich is pretty magical.\nA friend of mine raises camels\nat his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.\nHe has about eight of them,\nand he started 30 years ago\nbecause he thought\nhorses were too mundane.\nJohn is an out-of-the-box thinker,\nwhich explains why the two of us\nhave been such good friends\nall of our lives.\nOver the years, I've convinced him\nto shuttle those sweet furry beasts\nup to hang out with our sick kids\nfrom time to time.\nTalking to John, I was surprised to learn\nthat camels have an average\nlife expectancy of 40 to 50 years.\nThe life expectancy of many\nof the children with whom I work\nis less than a year.\n\n\n\n 1:12\n\n\nThis is a picture\nof the George Mark Children's House,\nthe first pediatric\npalliative respite care center\nto open in the United States.\nI founded it in 2004,\nafter years of working as a psychologist\non pediatric intensive care units,\nfrustrated with the undignified deaths\nthat so many children experienced\nand their families had to endure.\nAs I sat with families whose children\nwere at the end of their lives,\nI was acutely aware of our surroundings.\nWhile the elevated train\nrumbled overhead on its track,\nquite literally the room reverberated\nwith each passing train car.\nThe lights on the ward\nwere fluorescent and too bright.\nMonitors beeped, as did the elevator,\nnoisily announcing its arrival.\nThese families were experiencing\nsome of the most excruciating\nmoments of their lives,\nand I so wanted them\nto have a more peaceful place\nin which to say a last goodbye\nto their young daughters and sons.\nSurely, I thought,\nthere must be a better spot\nthan a hospital intensive care unit\nfor children at the end of their lives.\n\n\n\n 2:27\n\n\nOur children's house\nis calm and nurturing.\nIt's a place where families\ncan stay together\nto enjoy quality time with their children,\nmany of whom are there for respite stays,\nsome with repeated visits\nover a span of many years.\nWe call those kids our frequent flyers.\nRather than the bright,\nnoisy quarters of the hospital,\ntheir rooms are calm and comfortable,\nwith actual living spaces\nfor the families,\na sanctuary of gardens\nand a wonderful outdoor playground\nwith special structures\nfor children with physical limitations.\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\nThis sweet baby Lars\ncame to us directly\nfrom a hospital intensive care unit.\nImagine hearing the heartbreaking news\nthat none of us would ever want to hear.\nHis parents had been told\nthat Lars had a brain anomaly\nthat would keep him from ever swallowing,\nwalking, talking\nor developing mentally.\nRecognizing what little chance\nhe had for survival,\nhis parents chose\nto focus on the quality of time\nthat they could spend together.\nThey moved into\none of our family apartments\nand treasured each day that they had,\nwhich were far too few.\nLars's life was brief, to be sure,\nmere weeks,\nbut it was calm and comfortable.\nHe went on hikes with his parents.\nThe time that he spent in the pool\nwith our aquatic therapist\nlessened the seizures he was experiencing\nand helped him to sleep at night.\nHis family had a peaceful place\nin which to both celebrate his life\nand mourn his death.\n\n\n\n 4:12\n\n\nIt has been five years\nsince Lars was with us,\nand in that time,\nhis family has welcomed\na daughter and another son.\nThey are such a powerful testament\nto the positive outcome that specialized\nchildren's hospice care can create.\nTheir baby's physical discomfort\nwas well managed,\ngiving all of them the gift of time\nto be together in a beautiful place.\n\n\n\n 4:39\n\n\nI'm going to talk to you now\nabout the elephant\nrather than the camel in the room.\nVery few people want to talk about death,\nand even fewer about children's death.\nLoss of a child,\nespecially for those of us\nwho have our own children,\nis frightening,\nmore than frightening,\nparalyzing,\ndebilitating,\nimpossible.\nBut what I've learned is this:\nchildren don't stop dying\njust because we the adults\ncan't comprehend\nthe injustice of losing them.\nAnd what's more,\nif we can be brave enough\nto face the possibility of death,\neven among the most innocent,\nwe gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.\n\n\n\n 5:35\n\n\nTake Crystal, for example.\nShe was one of the first children\nto come for care\nafter we opened our doors.\nShe was nine when she arrived,\nand her neurologist expected\nthat she might live another two weeks.\nShe had an inoperable brain tumor,\nand her decline had really accelerated\nin the week before she came to us.\nAfter settling into her room,\ndressed entirely in pink and lavender,\nsurrounded by the Hello Kitty\naccessories that she loved,\nshe spent the next several days\nwinning over the hearts\nof every staff member.\nBit by bit, her condition stabilized,\nand then to our astonishment,\nshe actually improved.\nThere were a variety of factors\nthat contributed to Crystal's improvement\nwhich we later came to call\nthe \"George Mark bump,\"\na lovely, not uncommon phenomenon\nwhere children outlive\nthe prognoses of their illnesses\nif they're outside of the hospital.\nThe calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,\ntasty meals that were fixed\noften to accommodate her requests,\nthe resident pets,\nthe therapy dog and rabbit\nspent lots of cozy time with Crystal.\n\n\n\n 6:58\n\n\nAfter she had been with us\nfor about a week,\nshe called her grandmother,\nand she said,\n\"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,\nand there's room for you to come, too.\nAnd guess what?\nYou don't have to bring any quarters\nbecause the washer and dryer are free.\"\n\n\n\n 7:17\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:19\n\n\nCrystal's grandmother\nsoon arrived from out of town,\nand they spent the remaining\nfour months of Crystal's life\nenjoying very special days together.\nSome days were special because Crystal\nwas outside in her wheelchair\nsitting by the fountain.\nFor a little girl who had spent most\nof the year earlier in a hospital bed,\nbeing outside counting hummingbirds\nmade for an amazing time with her grandma,\nand lots of laughter.\nOther days were special\nbecause of the activities\nthat our child life specialist\ncreated for her.\nCrystal strung beads and made jewelry\nfor everybody in the house.\nShe painted a pumpkin\nto help decorate for Halloween.\nShe spent many excited days\nplanning her tenth birthday,\nwhich of course none of us\nthought she would ever see.\nAll of us wore pink boas for the occasion,\nand Crystal, as you can see,\nqueen for a day,\nwore a sparkly tiara.\n\n\n\n 8:19\n\n\nOne hot morning, I arrived at work\nand Crystal and her partner\nin crime, Charlie, greeted me.\nWith some help, they had set up\na lemonade and cookie stand\noutside the front door,\na very strategic location.\nI asked Crystal the price\nof the cookie that I had selected,\nand she said, \"Three dollars.\"\n\n\n\n 8:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:46\n\n\nI said that seemed a bit high\nfor one cookie.\n\n\n\n 8:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:51\n\n\nIt was small.\n\"I know,\" she acknowledged with a grin,\n\"but I'm worth it.\"\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\nAnd therein lie the words of wisdom\nof a young girl whose brief life\nforever impacted mine.\nCrystal was worth it,\nand shouldn't every child whose life\nis shortened by a horrific illness\nbe worth it?\nTogether, all of us today\ncan offer that same specialized care\nthat Crystal received\nby recognizing that children's\nrespite and hospice care\nis a critical component missing\nfrom our healthcare landscape.\nIt's also interesting to note\nthat we are able to provide this care\nat about one third of the cost\nof a hospital intensive care unit,\nand our families don't see a bill.\nWe are ever grateful to the supporters\nwho believe in this important work\nthat we're doing.\n\n\n\n 9:53\n\n\nThe truth is that my colleagues and I\nand the parents and other family members\nwho get to experience this special wisdom\nare in a unique position.\nThere are only two freestanding\npediatric hospices in the United States,\nalthough I'm happy to report\nthat based on our model,\nthere are 18 others\nunder various stages of development.\n\n\n\n10:17\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:22\n\n\nStill, most of the children\nwho die in the United States every year\ndie in hospital rooms,\nsurrounded by beeping machines\nand anxious, exhausted adults\nwho have no other option\nbut to say goodbye\nunder those harsh, institutional lights\nand among virtual strangers.\nFor comparison's sake,\nthe United Kingdom,\nwhich is a country with about one fifth\nthe population of the United States,\nand about half the size\nof the state of California,\nhas 54 hospice and respite centers.\nWhy is that?\nI've asked myself that question\nobviously many times.\nMy best guess is that Americans,\nwith our positive can-do attitude\nhold the expectation\nthat our medical care system will fix it,\neven though it may be a childhood illness\nfor which there is no cure.\nWe go to extraordinary measures\nto keep children alive\nwhen in fact the greatest kindness\nthat we might give them\nwould be a peaceful, pain-free\nend of life.\nThe transition from cure to care\nremains a challenging one\nfor many hospital physicians\nwhose training has really been\nabout saving lives,\nnot about gently guiding the patient\nto the end of life.\nThe dad of a sweet baby\nfor whom we cared at the end of her life\ncertainly captured this dichotomy\nwhen he reflected\nthat there are a lot of people\nto help you bring an infant into the world\nbut very few to help you usher a baby out.\n\n\n\n12:06\n\n\nSo what is the magic ingredient\nat George Mark?\nThe complex medical diagnoses\nthat bring our young patients to us\nmean that their lives\nhave often been restricted,\nsome to a hospital bed\nfor long periods of time,\nothers to wheelchairs,\nstill others to intensive courses\nof chemotherapy or rehab.\nWe make a practice\nof ignoring those limitations.\nOur default answer is \"yes\"\nand our default question is, \"Why not?\"\nThat's why we took a young boy\nwho wasn't going to live\nfor another baseball season\nto Game 5 of the World Series.\nThat's why we have a talent show\nput on by the staff and kids\nfor family and friends.\nWho wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy\nplaying a piano piece with his feet,\nbecause his arms are atrophied?\nThat's why we have a prom every year.\nIt's pretty magical.\nWe started the prom\nafter hearing a dad lament\nthat he would never pin\na boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.\nThe weeks before the dance,\nthe house is in a flurry,\nand I don't know who's more excited,\nthe staff or the kids.\n\n\n\n13:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:21\n\n\nThe night of the event\ninvolves rides in vintage cars,\na walk on a red carpet\ninto the great room,\na terrific DJ\nand a photographer at the ready\nto capture pictures of these attendees\nand their families.\nAt the end of the evening this year,\none of our young,\ndelightful teenaged girls,\nCaitlin, said to her mom,\n\"That was the best night\nof my whole life.\"\nAnd that's just the point,\nto capture the best days and nights,\nto abolish limitations,\nto have your default answer be \"yes\"\nand your default question be, \"Why not?\"\n\n\n\n14:10\n\n\nUltimately life is too short,\nwhether we live\nto be 85 years or just eight.\nTrust me.\nBetter yet, trust Sam.\nIt's not by pretending\nthat death doesn't exist\nthat we keep the people,\nespecially the little people that we love,\nsafe.\nIn the end,\nwe can't control how long any of us lives.\nWhat we can control\nis how we spend our days,\nthe spaces we create,\nthe meaning and joy that we make.\nWe cannot change the outcome,\nbut we can change the journey.\nIsn't it time\nto recognize that children deserve\nnothing less than our\nmost uncompromising bravery\nand our wildest imagination.\n\n\n\n15:08\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:09\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nThis picture\nis from my metro card\nwhen I spent a year abroad in Paris\nin college in the mid-'90s.\nMy friend says I look\nlike a French anarchist —\n\n\n\n 0:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:24\n\n\nBut this is still what I see\nwhen I look in the mirror in the morning.\nWithin a month of living in Paris,\nI'd lost 15 pounds\nand I was in the best shape of my life\nbecause I was eating fresh food\nand I was walking wherever I went.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\nHaving grown up in suburban Atlanta,\na region built largely\nby highways and automobiles\nand with a reputation\nas a poster child for sprawl,\nParis fundamentally changed\nthe way I understood\nthe construction of the world around me,\nand I got obsessed with the role\nof infrastructure —\nthat it's not just the way to move people\nfrom point A to point B,\nit's not just the way to convey water\nor sewage or energy,\nbut it's the foundation for our economy.\nIt's the foundation for our social life\nand for our culture,\nand it really matters\nto the way that we live.\n\n\n\n 1:13\n\n\nWhen I came home,\nI was instantly frustrated,\nstuck in traffic as I crossed\nthe top end of our perimeter highway.\nNot only was I not moving a muscle,\nI had no social interaction\nwith the hundreds of thousands of people\nthat were hurtling past me,\nlike me, with their eyes faced forward\nand their music blaring.\nI wondered if this was\nan inevitable outcome,\nor could we do something about it.\nWas it possible to transform\nthis condition in Atlanta\ninto the kind of place\nthat I wanted to live in?\n\n\n\n 1:42\n\n\nI went back to grad school\nin architecture and city planning,\ndeveloped this interest in infrastructure,\nand in 1999 came up with an idea\nfor my thesis project:\nthe adaptation of an obsolete loop\nof old railroad circling downtown\nas a new infrastructure\nfor urban revitalization.\nIt was just an idea.\nI never thought\nwe would actually build it.\nBut I went to work\nat an architecture firm,\nand eventually talked\nto my coworkers about it,\nand they loved the idea.\nAnd as we started talking\nto more people about it,\nmore people wanted to hear about it.\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nIn the summer of 2001,\nwe connected with Cathy Woolard,\nwho was soon elected\ncity council president.\nAnd we built a citywide vision\naround this idea:\nthe Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop\nof transit and trails and transformation.\nI was doing two and three meetings a week\nfor two and a half years,\nand so was Cathy and her staff\nand a handful of volunteers.\nTogether, we built this amazing movement\nof people and ideas.\nIt included community advocates\nwho were used to fighting against things,\nbut found the Atlanta BeltLine\nas something that they could fight for;\ndevelopers who saw the opportunity\nto take advantage of a lot\nof new growth in the city;\nand dozens of nonprofit partners\nwho saw their mission\nat least partly accomplished\nby the shared vision.\n\n\n\n 3:06\n\n\nNow, usually these groups of people\naren't at the same table\nwanting the same outcome.\nBut there we were,\nand it was kind of weird,\nbut it was really, really powerful.\nThe people of Atlanta\nfell in love with a vision\nthat was better than what they saw\nthrough their car windshields,\nand the people of Atlanta made it happen,\nand I guarantee you we would not\nbe building it otherwise.\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\nFrom the beginning,\nour coalition was diverse.\nPeople of all stripes\nwere part of our story.\nPeople on the lower end\nof the economic spectrum loved it, too.\nThey were just afraid\nthey weren't going to be able to be there\nwhen it got built,\nthat they'd be priced out.\nAnd we've all heard\nthat kind of story before, right?\nBut we promised that\nthe Atlanta BeltLine would be different,\nand people took ownership of the idea,\nand they made it better\nthan anything we ever imagined\nin the beginning,\nincluding significant\nsubsidies for housing,\nnew parks, art, an arboretum —\na list that continues to grow.\nAnd we put in place\nthe organizations and agencies\nthat were required to make it happen.\nAnd importantly, it is.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\nNow we're in the early stages\nof implementation, and it's working.\nThe first mainline section\nof trail was opened in 2012,\nand it's already generated\nover three billion dollars\nof private-sector investment.\nBut it's not only changing\nthe physical form of the city,\nit's changing the way\nwe think about the city,\nand what our expectations are\nfor living there.\nAbout a month ago,\nI had to take my kids with me\nto the grocery store\nand they were complaining about it,\nbecause they didn't want\nto get in the car.\nThey were saying, \"Dad, if we have to go,\ncan we at least ride our bikes?\"\nAnd I said, \"Of course we can.\nThat's what people in Atlanta do.\nWe ride our bikes to the grocery store.\"\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:01\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\nThank you, yeah.\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\nNow, they don't know\nhow ridiculous that is,\nbut I do.\nAnd I also understand\nthat their expectations for Atlanta\nare really powerful.\n\n\n\n 5:14\n\n\nThis kind of transformation\nis exactly like sprawl\nin the last century,\nthe movement where our investment\nin highways and automobiles\nfundamentally changed American life.\nThat wasn't some grand conspiracy.\nThere were conspiracies\nwithin it, of course.\nBut it was a cultural momentum.\nIt was millions of people\nmaking millions of decisions\nover an extended period of time,\nthat fundamentally changed\nnot only the way that we build cities,\nbut it changed our expectations\nfor our lives.\nThese changes were the foundations\nfor urban sprawl.\nWe didn't call it sprawl at that time.\nWe called it the future.\nAnd it was.\nAnd we got all the highways\nand strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.\n\n\n\n 5:58\n\n\nIt was a radical transformation,\nbut it was built by a cultural momentum.\nSo it's important to not separate\nthe physical construction\nof the places we live\nfrom other things that\nare happening at that time.\nAt that time,\nin the second half of the last century,\nscience was curing disease\nand lifting us to the moon,\nand the sexual revolution\nwas breaking down barriers,\nand the Civil Rights Movement\nbegan its march\ntoward the fulfillment\nof our nation's promise.\nTelevision, entertainment, food, travel,\nbusiness — everything was changing,\nand both the public\nand private sectors were colluding\nto give us the lives we wanted.\nThe Federal Highway Administration,\nfor example, didn't exist\nbefore there were highways.\nThink about it.\n\n\n\n 6:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:45\n\n\nOf course, today it's important\nto understand and acknowledge\nthat those benefits accrued\nto some groups of people\nand not to others.\nIt was not an equitable cultural momentum.\nBut when we look today\nin wonder and disgust, maybe,\nat the metropolis sprawl before us,\nwe wonder if we're stuck.\nAre we stuck with the legacy\nof that inequity?\nAre we stuck with this dystopian\ntraffic hellscape?\nAre we stuck with rampant\nurban displacement,\nwith environmental degradation?\nAre we stuck with social isolation\nor political polarization?\nAre these the inevitable\nand permanent outcomes?\nOr are they the result\nof our collective cultural decisions\nthat we've made for ourselves?\nAnd if they are,\ncan't we change them?\n\n\n\n 7:35\n\n\nWhat I have learned\nfrom our experience in Atlanta\nis not an anomaly.\nSimilar stories\nare playing out everywhere,\nwhere people are reclaiming\nnot only old railroads,\nbut also degraded urban waterways\nand obsolete roadways,\nreinventing all of the infrastructure\nin their lives.\nWhether here in New York\nor in Houston\nor Miami,\nDetroit, Philadelphia,\nSeoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,\nToronto and Paris,\ncities big and small all over the world\nare reclaiming and reinventing\nthis infrastructure for themselves,\nincluding the mother\nof all catalyst infrastructure projects,\nthe Los Angeles River,\nthe revitalization effort\nfor which similarly started\nas a grassroots movement,\nhas developed into a cultural momentum,\nand is now in the early stages\nof being transformed\ninto some kind of life-affirming\ninfrastructure again,\nthis one with trails and parks\nand fishing and boating\nand community revitalization,\nand of course, water quality\nand flood control.\nIt's already improving\nthe lives of people.\nIt's already changing the way\nthe rest of us think about Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n 8:46\n\n\nThis is more than just infrastructure.\nWe're building new lives for ourselves.\nIt's a movement that includes\nlocal food, urban agriculture,\ncraft beer, the maker movement,\ntech and design — all of these things,\nearly indicators of a really radical shift\nin the way we build cities.\nWe're taking places like this\nand transforming them into this.\nAnd soon this.\n\n\n\n 9:14\n\n\nAnd this is all exciting and good.\nWe're changing the world for the better.\nGood for us!\nAnd it is awesome — I mean that.\nBut our history of sprawl,\nand from what we can already see\nwith these catalyst projects today,\nwe know and must remember\nthat big changes like this\ndon't usually benefit everyone.\nThe market forces unleashed\nby this cultural momentum\noften include the seemingly unstoppable\nand inevitable cycle of rising taxes,\nprices and rents.\n\n\n\n 9:46\n\n\nThis is urgent.\nIf we care, we have to stand up\nand speak out.\nThis should be a call to action,\nbecause the answer can't be\nto not improve communities.\nThe answer can't be to not build parks\nand transit and grocery stores.\nThe answer can't be\nto hold communities down\njust to keep them affordable.\nBut we do have to follow through\nand address the financial realities\nthat we're facing.\nThis is hard, and it won't\nhappen on its own.\nWe can do it, and I'm committed\nto this goal in Atlanta,\nto sticking up again for people\nwho made it possible in the first place.\nWe can't call it a success without them.\nI certainly can't,\nbecause the people I made\ncommitments to all those years\nweren't abstract populations.\nThey're my friends and neighbors.\nThey're people that I love.\n\n\n\n10:35\n\n\nSo even though it started\nas my graduate thesis\nand I'm working hard for 16 years\nwith thousands of people\nto help make this thing come to life,\nI know and believe that who\nthe BeltLine is being built for\nis just as important\nas whether it's built at all.\nNot just in Atlanta,\nbut locally and globally,\nwe have to understand\nthis accountability to the people\nwhose lives we are changing,\nbecause this is us.\nWe are the lives we're talking about.\nThese places aren't inevitable.\nThe places we live aren't inevitable,\nand if we want something different,\nwe just need to speak up.\nWe have to ensure that change\ncomes on our terms.\nAnd to do that,\nwe have to participate actively\nin the process of shaping change.\n\n\n\n11:21\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:22\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nLast year, I got a chance to watch\nthe new \"Star Wars\" movie,\nwhich was fantastic,\nbut one thing kept bugging me.\nI don't know if you noticed this or not.\nIn this entirely technically\nadvanced world,\nI did not see a single AED anywhere,\nwhich was totally shocking —\nalmost as shocking\nas not knowing what an AED is,\nwhich you guys do know.\nBut for those at home,\nan AED is an automated\nexternal defibrillator.\nIt's the device you use\nwhen your heart goes into cardiac arrest\nto shock it back into a normal rhythm,\nor, as one of the guys I was teaching\na class to referred to it as:\n\"The shocky-hearty-box thing.\"\n\n\n\n 0:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:44\n\n\nBut I really can't blame the Empire,\nsince health and safety regulations\naren't really their first\norder of business.\nThough, even if we —\nI think worse than not having an AED\nwould be if there was one there,\nbut just, no one knew where to find it.\nThese devices can drastically increase\nyour chance of survival —\nalmost like a tauntaun on Hoth.\n\n\n\n 1:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:06\n\n\nBut I'm pretty sure\nthat stormtrooper is going to be toast,\nregardless if we have an AED or not,\nsince what happens is the chest plate\nis going to be quite hard to get off,\nand like that tauntaun,\nthe AED has a very short window of time\nat which it's highly effective.\nIn this case — basically, we've got\nto use it within the first 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n 1:25\n\n\nThe Jedi, on the other hand,\nhave no problems with their outfits.\nThose robes open straight up,\nyou can place the pads\nright onto the chest —\nso upper-right-hand side of the chest,\nlower left,\nwait for the unit to determine\nif it's a shockable rhythm\nand get ready to shock.\nBut, the Jedi do have a problem.\nThey have a head appendage issue.\nAnd so I can be totally clear,\nthinking I'm ready to go,\nbut I'm accidentally touching a tentacle\nand inadvertently shocking myself.\n\n\n\n 1:51\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:53\n\n\nSo before you hit that button,\nmake sure you are clear\nand everyone else is clear.\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nGoing back to that stormtrooper:\nIf I did get that chest plate off in time,\nwhat would you do if you suddenly found\nthere was a Wookiee under there,\nor possibly two Ewoks?\n\n\n\n 2:10\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\nWell, lucky for us,\nin the kit there's actually a razor,\nand we can use that to shave the chest\non the upper right-hand side\nand the lower left.\n\n\n\n 2:21\n\n\nWookiees also have another problem.\nThey have an accessory issue.\nWhat we want to do is remove these —\nanything between the two pads\nwe want to remove,\nsince it can cause\nsomething called \"arcing.\"\nFor those who don't know what arcing is,\ndo you remember the Emperor,\nwhen he shoots electricity\nout the ends of his fingers —\n\n\n\n 2:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:40\n\n\nthat would be kind of like arcing.\nAnother thing that —\nOh! By the way, he creates that\nby wearing wool socks under his robes.\n\n\n\n 2:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nWe can also get arcing if we have\nan extremely wet chest.\nThe electricity travels across the surface\ninstead of through the heart.\nWe can correct this with the immortal\nwords of Douglas Adams:\n\"Don't panic,\" which most of us\nhave done today —\nand also always having a towel.\nSo, good words to go by.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nThe metal bikini — unfortunately,\nthis is where panic sets in —\nlike the modern bra,\nwe have to make sure we remove,\nbecause this can cause\nsevere arcing along with burns.\nBut unfortunately this opens up an issue\nthat's almost as controversial\nas talking about the prequels.\n\n\n\n 3:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:22\n\n\nThe mere mention of the word \"nipples,\"\nand people get into a little\nbit of a tizzy.\nBy the way, that is not a nipple,\nthat's a cupcake.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\nChances are, if you do have to use this,\nthis is going to be on someone you know.\nAnd remember, everyone has nipples,\nexcept for Jabba.\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:40\n\n\nBut he does love cupcakes.\nSpeaking about Jabba,\nif we do have to use an AED on him,\nremember pad placement is the same,\neven though he doesn't have nipples.\nSo it's going to be\nupper right-hand side, lower left.\nIf we were going through, we're shocking,\ngetting ready to go —\nafter we've done the shock,\none of the things we need to do\nis remember to do compression.\nThe preferred method\nis 30 compressions and two breaths\nin the center of the chest,\nbetween the nipples,\npressing down at least two inches,\nno more than two and a half,\nat a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,\nno more than 120.\nUnfortunately, due to the size\nof Jabba's mouth\nand also what he puts in said mouth,\nwe may not want to actually\ndo the mouth-to-mouth part.\nSo instead, we can do\ncompression-only CPR.\nThe way of remembering\nthe compression-only part\nis we can actually use the Imperial March.\n\n\n\n 4:33\n\n\nI would sing it for you —\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nUnfortunately, that would be more\nsomething an interrogation droid would do.\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nYoda.\nSmall little guy, like a baby.\nWhat we do is basically\ntreat him like a baby,\nin the sense that we're going to place\none pad in the center of the chest\nand one in the back.\nIf we place them both in the front,\nthey can be too close\nand cause severe arcing,\nso we want to avoid that.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\nHopefully, this helped to clarify\nand put some light\non some of the darker issues\nof using an AED in the Star Wars universe,\nor any universe in total.\n\n\n\n 5:06\n\n\nI'll leave you with one point.\nRemember, if you do find yourself\ndealing with a Wookiee,\ndo not shave the entire Wookiee.\nThis takes way too much time,\nand it only pisses them off.\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:16\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n 5:17\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nTwenty-eight years ago,\nI was a broken man.\nAnd you probably wouldn't be able\nto tell that if you met me.\nI had a good job at a well-respected\nacademic institution.\nI dressed well, of course.\nBut my insides were rotting away.\nYou see, I grew up in a family\nriddled with addiction,\nand as a kid, I also struggled\nwith coming to terms\nwith my own sexuality.\nAnd even though I couldn't name it then,\ngrowing up as a gay kid\njust compounded my issues\nof isolation and insecurities.\nBut drinking took all of that away.\n\n\n\n 0:51\n\n\nLike many, I drank at an early age.\nI continued to drink\nmy way through college.\nAnd when I finally did come out\nin the early 1980s,\nabout the only places\nto meet other gay people,\nto socialize,\nto be yourself, were gay bars.\nAnd what do you do in gay bars?\nYou drink.\nAnd I did —\na lot.\n\n\n\n 1:16\n\n\nMy story is not unique.\nLike millions of Americans,\nmy disease progressed undiagnosed.\nIt took me to people\nand places and things\nthat I never would have chosen.\nIt wasn't until\nan intersection with the law\ngave me an \"opportunity\" to get care,\nthat I began my journey of recovery.\n\n\n\n 1:38\n\n\nMy journey of recovery\nhas been filled with love and with joy,\nbut it hasn't been without pain.\nLike many of you, I've lost too many\nfriends and family to this disease.\nI've heard too many\nheartbreaking stories\nof people who've lost\nloved ones to addiction.\nAnd I've also lost\ncountless friends to HIV and AIDS.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nOur current opioid epidemic\nand the AIDS epidemic\ntragically have much in common.\nRight now, we are in the midst of one\nof the greatest health crises of our time.\nDuring 2014 alone, 28,000 people\ndied of drug overdoses associated\nwith prescription drugs and heroin.\nDuring the 1980s, scores of people\nwere dying from HIV and AIDS.\nPublic officials ignored it.\nSome wouldn't even utter the words.\nThey didn't want treatment.\nAnd tragically, there are many parallels\nwith our current epidemic.\nSome called it the gay plague.\nThey called for quarantines.\nThey wanted to separate\nthe innocent victims from the rest of us.\nI was afraid we were losing this battle\nbecause people were\nblaming us for being sick.\nPublic policy was being held hostage\nby stigma and fear,\nand also held hostage\nwere compassion, care,\nresearch, recovery and treatment.\n\n\n\n 3:10\n\n\nBut we changed all that.\nBecause out of the pain of those deaths,\nwe saw a social and political movement.\nAIDS galvanized us into action;\nto stand up, to speak up and to act out.\nAnd it also galvanized\nthe LGBT movement.\nWe knew we were\nin a battle for our lives\nbecause silence equaled death,\nbut we changed,\nand we made things happen.\nAnd right now, we have the potential\nto see the end of HIV/AIDS\nin our lifetime.\nThese changes came in no small part\nby the courageous, yet simple decision\nfor people to come out\nto their neighbors,\nto their friends, to their families\nand to their coworkers.\n\n\n\n 4:07\n\n\nYears ago, I was a volunteer\nfor the Names Project.\nThis was an effort started\nby Cleve Jones in San Francisco\nto show that people who died of AIDS\nhad names\nand faces and families\nand people who loved them.\nI still recall unfolding\nthe AIDS memorial quilt\non the National Mall\non a brilliant day in October, 1988.\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nSo fast forward to 2015.\nThe Supreme Court's decision to strike\ndown the ban on same-sex marriage.\nMy husband, Dave, and I walk over\nto the steps of the Supreme Court\nto celebrate that decision\nwith so many other people,\nand I couldn't help but think\nhow far we came around LGBT rights\nand yet how far we needed to go\naround issues of addiction.\n\n\n\n 5:09\n\n\nWhen I was nominated\nby President Obama\nto be his Director of Drug Policy,\nI was very open about my recovery\nand about the fact that I was a gay man.\nAnd at no point during\nmy confirmation process —\nat least that I know of —\ndid the fact that I was a gay man\ncome to bear on my candidacy\nor my fitness to do this job.\nBut my addiction did.\nAt one point, a congressional staffer\nsaid that there was no way\nthat I was going to be confirmed\nby the United States Senate\nbecause of my past,\ndespite the fact that I had been\nin recovery for over 20 years,\nand despite the fact\nthat this job takes a little bit\nof knowledge around addiction.\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nSo, you know, this is the stigma\nthat people with\nsubstance use disorders\nface every single day,\nand you know, I have to tell you\nit's still why I'm more comfortable\ncoming out as a gay man\nthan I am as a person\nwith a history of addiction.\n\n\n\n 6:06\n\n\nNearly every family in America\nis affected by addiction.\nYet, unfortunately, too often,\nit's not talked about openly and honestly.\nIt's whispered about.\nIt's met with derision and scorn.\nWe hear these stories,\ntime and time again, on TV, online,\nwe hear it from public officials,\nand we hear it from family and friends.\nAnd those of us with an addiction,\nwe hear those voices,\nand somehow we believe that we are\nless deserving of care and treatment.\nToday in the United States,\nonly one in nine people\nget care and treatment for their disorder.\nOne in nine.\nThink about that.\n\n\n\n 6:51\n\n\nGenerally, people with other diseases\nget care and treatment.\nIf you have cancer, you get treatment,\nif you have diabetes, you get treatment.\nIf you have a heart attack,\nyou get emergency services,\nand you get referred to care.\nBut somehow people with addiction\nhave to wait for treatment\nor often can't get when they need it.\nAnd left untreated, addiction\nhas significant, dire consequences.\nAnd for many people\nthat means death or incarceration.\nWe've been down that road before.\n\n\n\n 7:22\n\n\nFor too long our country felt\nlike we could arrest our way\nout of this problem.\nBut we know that we can't.\nDecades of scientific research has shown\nthat this is a medical issue —\nthat this is a chronic medical condition\nthat people inherit\nand that people develop.\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\nSo the Obama administration\nhas taken a different tack on drug policy.\nWe've developed and implemented\na comprehensive plan\nto expand prevention services,\ntreatment services,\nearly intervention and recovery support.\nWe've pushed criminal justice reform.\nWe've knocked down barriers\nto give people second chances.\nWe see public health and public safety\nofficials working hand in hand\nat the community level.\nWe see police chiefs across the country\nguiding people to treatment\ninstead of jail and incarceration.\nWe see law enforcement\nand other first responders\nreversing overdoses with naloxone\nto give people a second chance for care.\nThe Affordable Care Act\nis the biggest expansion\nof substance use disorder\ntreatment in a generation,\nand it also calls for the integration\nof treatment services within primary care.\nBut fundamentally,\nall of this work is not enough.\nUnless we change the way\nthat we view people with addiction\nin the United States.\n\n\n\n 8:46\n\n\nYears ago when I finally\nunderstood that I had a problem\nand I knew that I needed help,\nI was too afraid to ask for it.\nI felt that people would think\nI was stupid, that I was weak-willed,\nthat I was morally flawed.\nBut I talk about my recovery\nbecause I want to make change.\nI want us to see that we need to be open\nand candid about who we are\nand what we can do.\nI am public about my own recovery\nnot to be self-congratulatory.\nI am open about my own recovery\nto change public opinion,\nto change public policy\nand to change the course of this epidemic\nand empower the millions of Americans\nwho struggle with this journey\nto be open and candid\nabout who they are.\nPeople are more than their disease.\nAnd all of us have the opportunity\nto change public opinion\nand to change public policy.\n\n\n\n 9:47\n\n\nAll of us know someone\nwho has an addiction,\nand all of us can do our part\nto change how we view people\nwith addiction in the United States.\nSo when you see\nsomeone with an addiction,\ndon't think of a drunk or a junkie\nor an addict or an abuser —\nsee a person;\noffer them help;\ngive them kindness and compassion.\nAnd together, we can be part\nof a growing movement\nin the United States\nto change how we view\npeople with addiction.\n\n\n\n10:20\n\n\nTogether we can change public policy.\nWe can ensure that people\nget care when they need it,\njust like any other disease.\nWe can be part of a growing,\nunstoppable movement\nto have millions of Americans\nenter recovery,\nand put an end to this epidemic.\n\n\n\n10:38\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n10:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI'm a marine biologist\nand an explorer-photographer\nwith National Geographic,\nbut I want to share a secret.\nThis image is totally incorrect,\ntotally incorrect.\nI see a couple of people\ncrying in the back\nthat I've blown their idea of mermaids.\nAll right, the mermaid is indeed real,\nbut anyone who's gone on a dive\nwill know that the ocean\nlooks more like this.\nIt's because the ocean\nis this massive filter,\nand as soon as you start going underwater,\nyou're going to lose your colors,\nand it's going to get dark\nand blue very quickly.\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nBut we're humans —\nwe're terrestrial mammals.\nAnd we've got trichromatic vision,\nso we see in red, green and blue,\nand we're just complete color addicts.\nWe love eye-popping color,\nand we try to bring this eye-popping color\nunderwater with us.\n\n\n\n 1:04\n\n\nSo there's been a long and sordid history\nof bringing color underwater,\nand it starts 88 years ago\nwith Bill Longley and Charles Martin,\nwho were trying to take\nthe first underwater color photograph.\nAnd they're in there\nwith old-school scuba suits,\nwhere you're pumping air down to them,\nand they've got a pontoon\nof high-explosive magnesium powder,\nand the poor people\nat the surface are not sure\nwhen they're going to pull the string\nwhen they've got their frame in focus,\nand — boom! — a pound\nof high explosives would go off\nso they could put\na little bit of light underwater\nand get an image\nlike this beautiful hogfish.\nI mean, it's a gorgeous image,\nbut this is not real.\nThey're creating an artificial environment\nso we can satisfy\nour own addiction to color.\n\n\n\n 1:50\n\n\nAnd looking at it the other way,\nwhat we've been finding\nis that instead of bringing color\nunderwater with us,\nthat we've been looking at the blue ocean,\nand it's a crucible of blue,\nand these animals living there\nfor millions of years\nhave been evolving all sorts of ways\nto take in that blue light\nand give off other colors.\nAnd here's just a little sample\nof what this secret world looks like.\nIt's like an underwater light show.\n\n\n\n 2:17\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 2:22\n\n\nAgain, what we're seeing here\nis blue light hitting this image.\nThese animals are absorbing the blue light\nand immediately transforming this light.\n\n\n\n 2:34\n\n\nSo if you think about it, the ocean\nis 71 percent of the planet,\nand blue light can extend down\nto almost a 1,000 meters.\nAs we go down underwater,\nafter about 10 meters,\nall the red is gone.\nSo if you see anything\nunder 10 meters that's red,\nit's an animal transforming\nand creating its own red.\nThis is the largest single monochromatic\nblue environment on our planet.\n\n\n\n 3:01\n\n\nAnd my gateway into this world\nof biofluorescence begins with corals.\nAnd I want to give\na full TED Talk on corals\nand just how cool these things are.\nOne of the things that they do,\none of their miraculous feats,\nis they produce lots of these\nfluorescent proteins,\nfluorescent molecules.\nAnd in this coral, it could be making\nup to 14 percent of its body mass —\ncould be this fluorescent protein.\nSo you wouldn't be making, like,\n14 percent muscle and not using it,\nso it's likely doing something\nthat has a functional role.\nAnd for the last 10, 15 years,\nthis was so special to me,\nbecause this molecule has turned out\nto be one of the most revolutionary tools\nin biomedical science,\nand it's allowing us\nto better see inside ourselves.\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\nSo, how do I study this?\nIn order to study biofluorescence,\nwe swim at night.\nAnd when I started out,\nI was just using these blue\nduct-tape filters over my strobe,\nso I could make sure\nI'm actually seeing the light\nthat's being transformed by the animals.\nWe're making an exhibit\nfor the Museum of Natural History,\nand we're trying to show off how great\nthe fluorescent corals are on the reef,\nand something happened\nthat just blew me away:\nthis.\nIn the middle of our corals,\nis this green fluorescent fish.\nIt's the first time we've ever seen\na green fluorescent fish\nor any vertebrate for that matter.\nAnd we're rubbing our eyes,\nchecking the filters,\nthinking that somebody's maybe\nplaying a joke on us with the camera,\nbut the eel was real.\n\n\n\n 4:32\n\n\nIt was the first green\nfluorescent eel that we found,\nand this just changed\nmy trajectory completely.\nSo I had to put down my corals and team up\nwith a fish scientist, John Sparks,\nand begin a search around the world\nto see how prevalent this phenomenon is.\nAnd fish are much more\ninteresting than corals,\nbecause they have really advanced vision,\nand some of the fish even have,\nthe way that I was photographing it,\nthey have lenses in their eyes\nthat would magnify the fluorescence.\nSo I wanted to seek this out further.\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\nSo we designed a new set of gear\nand we're scouring the reefs\naround the world,\nlooking for fluorescent life.\nAnd it's a bit like \"E.T. phone home.\"\nWe're out there swimming\nwith this blue light,\nand we're looking for a response,\nfor animals to be absorbing the light\nand transferring this back to us.\nAnd eventually, we found\nour photobombing Kaupichphys eel.\nIt's a really shy, reclusive eel\nthat we know almost nothing about.\nThey're only about the size of my finger,\nand they spend about 99.9 percent\nof their time hidden under a rock.\nBut these eels do come out to mate\nunder full-moon nights,\nand that full-moon night\ntranslates underwater to blue.\nPerhaps they're using this\nas a way to see each other,\nquickly find each other, mate,\ngo back into their hole\nfor the next long stint of time.\nBut then we started to find\nother fluorescent marine life,\nlike this green fluorescent bream,\nwith its, like, racing stripes\nalong its head and its nape,\nand it's almost camouflaged\nand fluorescing at the same intensity\nas the fluorescent coral there.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nAfter this fish,\nwe were introduced to this red\nfluorescent scorpionfish\ncloaked and hidden on this rock.\nThe only time we've ever seen this,\nit's either on red fluorescent algae\nor red fluorescent coral.\n\n\n\n 6:23\n\n\nLater, we found this stealthy\ngreen fluorescent lizardfish.\nThese lizardfish come in many varieties,\nand they look almost exactly alike\nunder white light.\nBut if you look at them\nunder fluorescent light,\nyou see lots of patterns,\nyou can really see\nthe differences among them.\nAnd in total — we just reported\nthis last year —\nwe found over 200 species\nof biofluorescent fish.\n\n\n\n 6:49\n\n\nOne of my inspirations is French artist\nand biologist Jean Painlevé.\nHe really captures this entrepreneuring,\ncreative spirit in biology.\nHe would design his own gear,\nmake his own cameras,\nand he was fascinated with the seahorse,\nHippocampus erectus,\nand he filmed for the first time\nthe seahorse giving birth.\nSo this is the male seahorse.\nThey were one of the first fish\nto start swimming upright\nwith their brain above their head.\nThe males give birth,\njust phenomenal creatures.\nSo he stayed awake for days.\nHe even put this electrical visor\non his head that would shock him,\nso he could capture this moment.\nNow, I wish I could have shown Painlevé\nthe moment where we found\nbiofluorescent seahorses\nin the exact same species\nthat he was studying.\nAnd here's our footage.\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 7:45\n\n\nThey're the most cryptic fish.\nYou could be swimming right on top of them\nand not see the seahorse.\nThey would blend right into the algae,\nwhich would also fluoresce red,\nbut they've got great vision,\nand they go through\nthis long mating ritual,\nand perhaps they're using it\nin that effect.\n\n\n\n 8:02\n\n\nBut things got pretty edgy\nwhen we found green\nfluorescence in the stingray,\nbecause stingrays are\nin the Elasmobranch class,\nwhich includes ...\nsharks.\nSo I'm, like, a coral biologist.\nSomebody's got to go down and check\nto see if the sharks are fluorescent.\nAnd there I am.\n\n\n\n 8:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:27\n\n\nAnd I was like, \"Maybe I should\ngo back to corals.\"\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:30\n\n\nIt turns out that these sharks\nare not fluorescent.\nAnd then we found it.\nIn a deep, dark canyon\noff the coast of California,\nwe found the first\nbiofluorescent swellshark,\nright underneath all the surfers.\nHere it is.\nThey're just about a meter long.\nIt's called a swellshark.\nAnd they call them a swellshark\nbecause if they're threatened,\nthey can gulp down water\nand blow up like an inner tube,\nabout twice their size,\nand wedge themselves under a rock,\nso they don't get eaten by a predator.\nAnd here is our first footage\nof these biofluorescent swellsharks.\nJust magnificent — I mean,\nthey're showing these distinct patterns,\nand there are areas that are fluorescent\nand areas that are not fluorescent,\nbut they've also got these\ntwinkling spots on them\nthat are much brighter\nthan other parts of the shark.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nBut this is all beautiful to see.\nI was like, this is gorgeous.\nBut what does it mean to the shark?\nCan they see this?\nAnd we looked in the literature,\nand nothing was known\nabout this shark's vision.\nSo I took this shark to eye specialist\nEllis Loew at Cornell University,\nand we found out that this shark\nsees discretely and acutely\nin the blue-green interface,\nprobably about 100 times better\nthan we can see in the dark,\nbut they only see blue-green.\nSo what it's doing\nis taking this blue world\nand it's absorbing the blue,\ncreating green.\nIt's creating contrast\nthat they can indeed see.\nSo we have a model,\nshowing that it creates an ability\nfor them to see all these patterns.\nAnd males and females\nalso have, we're finding,\ndistinct patterns among them.\n\n\n\n10:08\n\n\nBut our last find came really just\na few miles from where we are now,\nin the Solomon Islands.\nSwimming at night, I encountered\nthe first biofluorescent sea turtle.\nSo now it's going from fish\nand sharks into reptiles,\nwhich, again, this is only one month old,\nbut it shows us\nthat we know almost nothing\nabout this hawksbill turtle's vision.\nAnd it makes me think about\nhow much more there is to learn.\nAnd here in the Solomon Islands,\nthere's only a few thousand\nbreeding females of this species left,\nand this is one of the hotspots for them.\nSo it shows us how much we need\nto really protect these animals\nwhile they're still here,\nand understand them.\n\n\n\n10:46\n\n\nIn thinking about biofluorescence,\nI wanted to know, how deep does it go?\nDoes this go all the way\nto the bottom of the ocean?\nSo we started using submarines,\nand we equipped them\nwith special blue lights\non the front here.\nAnd we dropped down,\nand we noticed one important thing —\nthat as we get down to 1,000 meters,\nit drops off.\nThere's no biofluorescent marine life\ndown there, below 1,000 meters —\nalmost nothing, it's just darkness.\nSo it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.\nAnd below 1,000 meters,\nwe encountered the bioluminescent zone,\nwhere nine out of 10 animals\nare actually making their own lights\nand flashing and blinking.\n\n\n\n11:26\n\n\nAs I try to get deeper,\nthis is slapping on a one-person\nsubmarine suit —\nsome people call this my \"Jacques Cousteau\nmeets Woody Allen\" moment.\n\n\n\n11:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:35\n\n\nBut as we explore down here,\nI was thinking about: How do we\ninteract with life delicately?\nBecause we're entering\na new age of exploration,\nwhere we have to take great care,\nand we have to set examples\nhow we explore.\nSo I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood\nat Harvard University,\nand we've been designing\nsquishy underwater robot fingers,\nso we can delicately interact\nwith the marine life down there.\nThe idea is that most of our technologies\nto explore the deep ocean\ncome from oil and gas and military,\nwho, you know, they're not really\ncaring to be gentle.\nSome corals could be 1,000 years old.\nYou don't want to just go\nand crush them with a big claw.\nSo my dream is something like this.\nAt night, I'm in a submarine,\nI have force-feedback gloves,\nand I could delicately set up\na lab in the front of my submarine,\nwhere the squishy robot fingers\nare delicately collecting\nand putting things in jars,\nand we can conduct our research.\n\n\n\n12:33\n\n\nBack to the powerful applied applications.\nHere, you're looking at a living brain\nthat's using the DNA\nof fluorescent marine creatures,\nthis one from jellyfish and corals,\nto illuminate the living brain\nand see its connections.\nIt's funny that we're using RGB\njust to kind of satisfy\nour own human intuition,\nso we can see our brains better.\nAnd even more mind-blowing,\nis my close colleague\nVincent Pieribone at Yale,\nwho has actually designed and engineered\na fluorescent protein\nthat responds to voltage.\nSo he could see\nwhen a single neuron fires.\nYou're essentially looking at\na portal into consciousness\nthat was designed by marine creatures.\n\n\n\n13:17\n\n\nSo this brings me all back\nto perspective and relationship.\nFrom deep space,\nour universe looks\nlike a human brain cell,\nand then here we are in the deep ocean,\nand we're finding\nmarine creatures and cells\nthat can illuminate the human mind.\nAnd it's my hope\nthat with illuminated minds,\nwe could ponder the overarching\ninterconnectedness of all life,\nand fathom how much more lies in store\nif we keep our oceans healthy.\n\n\n\n13:46\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nTwo months ago, my kids and I\nhuddled around a cell phone\nwatching the live stream\nof the Game Awards,\none of the video game\nindustry's biggest nights.\nThey announced the nominees\nfor the Game for Impact,\nan award that's given\nto a thought-provoking video game\nwith a profound prosocial\nmessage or meaning.\nThey opened the envelope\nand they read the title of our video game.\nAn award ...\nfor impact.\nIt was almost funny, actually,\nbecause I always thought\nthat winning an award like that\nwould have this huge impact on my life,\nbut I found that the opposite is true.\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nThe big nights,\nthe accomplishments —\nthey fade.\nBut the hardest nights of my life\nhave stuck with me,\nimpacting who I am\nand what I do.\n\n\n\n 1:04\n\n\nIn 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed\nwith a rare and aggressive brain tumor.\nAnd before that year was finished,\ndoctors sat my husband and I down\nand let us know\nthat his tumor had returned\ndespite the most aggressive chemotherapy\nand radiation that they could offer him.\nOn that terrible night,\nafter learning that Joel\nhad perhaps four months to live,\nI cuddled up with\nmy two older sons in bed —\nthey were five and three at the time —\nand I never really knew\nhow much they understood,\nso I started telling them a bedtime story.\nI told them about this\nvery brave knight named Joel\nand his adventure fighting\na terrible dragon called cancer.\nEvery night, I told them\nmore of the story,\nbut I never let the story end.\nI was just building up a context\nthat they could understand\nand hoping that our prayers\nwould be answered\nand I would never\nhave to tell them that that knight,\nwho had fought so bravely,\nwas done fighting\nand could rest now, forever.\n\n\n\n 2:13\n\n\nFortunately, I never did have to\nfinish that bedtime story.\nMy children outgrew it.\nJoel responded better than anyone expected\nto palliative treatment,\nand so instead of months,\nwe spent years learning how to love\nour dying child with all of our hearts.\nLearning to recognize\nthat shameful feeling\nof holding back just a little love\nto try to spare ourselves\njust a little pain\nsomewhere further down the road.\nWe pushed past that self-preservation\nbecause Joel was worth loving\neven if that love could crush us.\nAnd that lesson of intense\nvulnerability has changed me ...\nmore than any award ever could.\n\n\n\n 3:01\n\n\nWe started living like Joel could live,\nand we began developing a video game\ncalled \"That Dragon, Cancer.\"\nIt was the story of Joel.\nIt was the story of hope\nin the shadow of death.\nIt was the story of faith\nand doubt,\nand the realization that a wrestle\nwith doubt is a part of faith —\nmaybe the biggest part of it.\nIt was a story that began as a miracle\nand ended as a memorial.\n\n\n\n 3:36\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\n(Giggle)\n\n\n\n 3:40\n\n\n(Clapping)\n\n\n\n 3:41\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 3:45\n\n\n(Video) Dad: Bouncing around,\ndo you like that?\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\n(Giggle)\n\n\n\n 3:49\n\n\nI love your giggle.\n\n\n\n 3:50\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 3:57\n\n\n(Giggle)\n\n\n\n 4:00\n\n\n[A Journey of Hope In the Shadow of Death]\n\n\n\n 4:06\n\n\n[That Dragon, Cancer]\n\n\n\n 4:09\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nWhen you play \"That Dragon, Cancer,\"\nyou're transformed\ninto a witness of Joel's life,\nexploring an emotional landscape,\nclicking to discover more of what\nwe as a family felt and experienced.\nIt feels a little bit\nlike analyzing interactive poetry\nbecause every game mechanic is a metaphor,\nand so the more the player asks themselves\nwhat we as designers\nwere trying to express and why,\nthe richer the experience becomes.\n\n\n\n 4:44\n\n\nWe took that vulnerability\nthat Joel taught us,\nand we encoded the game with it.\nPlayers expect their video games\nto offer them branching narrative\nso that every decision\nthat they make feels important\nand can change the outcome of the game.\nWe subverted that principle\nof game design,\ncollapsing the choices in on the player\nso that they discover for themselves\nthat there is nothing that they can do\nthat will change the outcome for Joel.\nAnd they feel that discovery\nas deeply and desperately as we felt it\non nights when we held Joel\nin our arms praying for hours,\nstubbornly holding out hope for a grace\nthat we could not create for ourselves.\n\n\n\n 5:29\n\n\nWe'd all prefer to win,\nbut when you discover that you can't win,\nwhat do you value instead?\n\n\n\n 5:38\n\n\nI never planned to write video games,\nbut these moments\nthat really change our lives,\nthey often come as the result\nof our hardship — and not our glory.\nWhen we thought that Joel could live,\nI left the game designing to my husband.\nI chimed in here and there\nwith a scene or two and some suggestions.\nBut after the night that Joel died,\nthe passion,\nthe possibility of sharing Joel's life\nthrough our video game —\nit was something that I couldn't resist.\nI started writing more,\nI sat in on our team's design meetings,\nI added more ideas\nand I helped direct scenes.\nAnd I discovered that creating\na video game is telling a story,\nbut with an entirely new vocabulary.\nAll the same elements of imagination\nand symbolism are there,\nbut they're just partnered\nwith player agency\nand system responsiveness.\nIt's challenging work.\nI have to think\nin a totally new way to do it,\nbut I love it.\nAnd I wouldn't have known\nthat without Joel.\n\n\n\n 6:45\n\n\nMaybe you're a little surprised\nby our choice to share our story\nof terminal cancer through a video game.\nPerhaps you're even thinking\nlike so many people before you:\ncancer is not a game.\nWell, tell that\nto any pediatric cancer parent\nthat's ever taken an exam glove\nand blown it up into a balloon,\nor transformed a syringe\ninto a rocket ship,\nor let their child ride their IV pole\nthrough the hospital halls\nlike it was a race car.\nBecause when you have children,\neverything is a game.\nAnd when your young child\nexperiences something traumatic,\nyou work even harder to make sure\nthat their life feels like a game\nbecause children naturally\nexplore their worlds through play.\nWhile cancer can steal\nmany things from a family,\nit shouldn't steal play.\n\n\n\n 7:38\n\n\nIf you're listening to me\nand you're trying to imagine this family\nthat revolves entirely\naround a dying child,\nand you can't imagine joy\nas part of that picture,\nthen we were right\nto share our story with you,\nbecause that season of our life was hard.\nUnspeakably hard at times,\nbut it was also pure hope,\ndeep love\nand joy like I have never\nexperienced since.\nOur video game was our attempt\nto share that world\nwith people who hadn't\nexperienced it before,\nbecause we never could imagine\nthat world until it became ours.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nWe made a video game that's hard to play.\nIt will never be a blockbuster.\nPeople have to prepare themselves\nto invest emotionally\nin a story that they know\nwill break their hearts.\nBut when our hearts break,\nthey heal a little differently.\nMy broken heart has been healing\nwith a new and a deeper compassion —\na desire to sit with people in their pain,\nto hear their stories\nand try to help tell them\nso that they know that they're seen.\n\n\n\n 8:55\n\n\nOn the night when \"That Dragon, Cancer\"\nwon the Game for Impact Award,\nwe cheered,\nwe smiled and we talked about Joel\nand the impact he had on our life —\non all of those hard and hopeful nights\nthat we shared with him\nwhen he changed our hearts\nand taught us so much more\nabout life and love and faith and purpose.\nThat award will never mean as much to me\nas even a single photograph of my son,\nbut it does represent all of the people\nwho his life has impacted,\npeople I'll never meet.\nThey write me emails sometimes.\nThey tell me that they miss Joel,\neven though they never met him.\nThey describe the tears\nthat they've shed for my son,\nand it makes my burden of grief\njust a little bit lighter\nknowing that it's shared\nwith a 10-year-old\nwatching a YouTube playthrough,\nor a doctor playing on his airplane\nwith a smartphone,\nor a professor introducing Joel\nto her first-year philosophy students.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nWe made a video game that's hard to play.\nBut that feels just right to me,\nbecause the hardest moments of our lives\nchange us more than any goal\nwe could ever accomplish.\nTragedy has shifted my heart\nmore than any dream\nI could ever see come true.\n\n\n\n10:27\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhat if I told you\nthere was a new technology\nthat, when placed in the hands\nof doctors and nurses,\nimproved outcomes for children\nand adults, patients of all ages;\nreduced pain and suffering,\nreduced time in the operating rooms,\nreduced anesthetic times,\nhad the ultimate dose-response curve\nthat the more you did it,\nthe better it benefitted patients?\nHere's a kicker: it has no side effects,\nand it's available no matter\nwhere care is delivered.\nI can tell you as an ICU doctor\nat Boston Children's Hospital,\nthis would be a game changer for me.\nThat technology is lifelike rehearsal.\nThis lifelike rehearsal is being delivered\nthrough medical simulation.\n\n\n\n 1:04\n\n\nI thought I would start with a case,\njust to really describe\nthe challenge ahead,\nand why this technology is not just\ngoing to improve health care\nbut why it's critical to health care.\nThis is a child that's born, young girl.\n\"Day of life zero,\" we call it,\nthe first day of life,\njust born into the world.\nAnd just as she's being born,\nwe notice very quickly\nthat she is deteriorating.\nHer heart rate is going up,\nher blood pressure is going down,\nshe's breathing very, very fast.\nAnd the reason for this\nis displayed in this chest X-ray.\n\n\n\n 1:40\n\n\nThat's called a babygram,\na full X-ray of a child's body,\na little infant's body.\nAs you look on the top side of this,\nthat's where the heart and lungs\nare supposed to be.\nAs you look at the bottom end,\nthat's where the abdomen is,\nand that's where the intestines\nare supposed to be.\nAnd you can see how\nthere's sort of that translucent area\nthat made its way up into the right side\nof this child's chest.\nAnd those are the intestines —\nin the wrong place.\nAs a result, they're pushing on the lungs\nand making it very difficult\nfor this poor baby to breathe.\n\n\n\n 2:10\n\n\nThe fix for this problem\nis to take this child immediately\nto the operating room,\nbring those intestines\nback into the abdomen,\nlet the lungs expand\nand allow this child to breathe again.\nBut before she can go\nto the operating room,\nshe must get whisked away\nto the ICU, where I work.\nI work with surgical teams.\nWe gather around her,\nand we place this child\non heart-lung bypass.\nWe put her to sleep,\nwe make a tiny\nlittle incision in the neck,\nwe place catheters into the major\nvessels of the neck —\nand I can tell you that these vessels\nare about the size of a pen,\nthe tip of a pen —\nand then we have blood\ndrawn from the body,\nwe bring it through a machine,\nit gets oxygenated,\nand it goes back into the body.\nWe save her life,\nand get her safely to the operating room.\n\n\n\n 3:00\n\n\nHere's the problem:\nthese disorders —\nwhat is known is congenital\ndiaphragmatic hernia —\nthis hole in the diaphragm that has\nallowed these intestines to sneak up —\nthese disorders are rare.\nEven in the best hands in the world,\nthere is still a challenge\nto get the volume —\nthe natural volume of these patients —\nin order to get our expertise\ncurve at 100 percent.\nThey just don't present that often.\nSo how do you make the rare common?\n\n\n\n 3:35\n\n\nHere's the other problem:\nin the health care system\nthat I trained for over 20 years,\nwhat currently exists,\nthe model of training is called\nthe apprenticeship model.\nIt's been around for centuries.\nIt's based on this idea that you see\na surgery maybe once,\nmaybe several times,\nyou then go do that surgery,\nand then ultimately you teach\nthat surgery to the next generation.\nAnd implicit in this model —\nI don't need to tell you this —\nis that we practice on the very patients\nthat we are delivering care to.\nThat's a problem.\nI think there's a better approach.\nMedicine may very well be the last\nhigh-stakes industry\nthat does not practice prior to game time.\nI want to describe to you a better\napproach through medical simulation.\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\nWell, the first thing we did is we went\nto other high-stakes industries\nthat had been using this type\nof methodology for decades.\nThis is nuclear power.\nNuclear power runs scenarios\non a regular basis\nin order to practice\nwhat they hope will never occur.\nAnd as we're all very familiar,\nthe airline industry —\nwe all get on planes now,\ncomforted by the idea\nthat pilots and crews have trained\non simulators much like these,\ntraining on scenarios\nthat we hope will never occur,\nbut we know if they did,\nthey would be prepared for the worst.\nIn fact, the airline industry has gone\nas far as to create fuselages\nof simulation environments,\nbecause of the importance\nof the team coming together.\nThis is an evacuation drill simulator.\nSo again, if that ever were to happen,\nthese rare, rare events,\nthey're ready to act\non the drop of a dime.\n\n\n\n 5:33\n\n\nI guess the most compelling for me\nin some ways is the sports industry —\narguably high stakes.\nYou think about a baseball team:\nbaseball players practice.\nI think it's a beautiful example\nof progressive training.\nThe first thing they do\nis go out to spring training.\nThey go to a spring training camp,\nperhaps a simulator in baseball.\nThey're not on the real field,\nbut they're on a simulated field,\nand they're playing in the pregame season.\nThen they make their way to the field\nduring the season games,\nand what's the first thing they do\nbefore they start the game?\nThey go into the batting cage\nand do batting practice for hours,\nhaving different types of pitches\nbeing thrown at them,\nhitting ball after ball\nas they limber their muscles,\ngetting ready for the game itself.\nAnd here's the most\nphenomenal part of this,\nand for all of you who watch\nany sport event,\nyou will see this phenomenon happen.\nThe batter gets into the batter's box,\nthe pitcher gets ready to pitch.\nRight before the pitch is thrown,\nwhat does that batter do?\nThe batter steps out of the box\nand takes a practice swing.\nHe wouldn't do it any other way.\n\n\n\n 6:48\n\n\nI want to talk to you about how\nwe're building practice swings like this\nin medicine.\nWe are building batting cages\nfor the patients that we care about\nat Boston Children's.\nI want to use this case\nthat we recently built.\nIt's the case of a four-year-old\nwho had a progressively enlarging head,\nand as a result,\nhad loss of developmental milestones,\nneurologic milestones,\nand the reason for this problem is here —\nit's called hydrocephalus.\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\nSo, a quick study in neurosurgery.\nThere's the brain,\nand you can see the cranium\nsurrounding the brain.\nWhat surrounds the brain,\nbetween the brain and cranium,\nis something called\ncerebrospinal fluid or fluid,\nwhich acts as a shock absorber.\nIn your heads right now,\nthere is cerebrospinal fluid\njust bathing your brains\nand making its way around.\nIt's produced in one area\nand flows through,\nand then is re-exchanged.\nAnd this beautiful flow pattern\noccurs for all of us.\nBut unfortunately in some children,\nthere's a blockage of this flow pattern,\nmuch like a traffic jam.\nAs a result, the fluid accumulates,\nand the brain is pushed aside.\nIt has difficulty growing.\nAs a result, the child loses\nneurologic milestones.\nThis is a devastating disease in children.\n\n\n\n 8:07\n\n\nThe cure for this is surgery.\nThe traditional surgery is to take\na bit of the cranium off,\na bit of the skull,\ndrain this fluid out,\nstick a drain in place,\nand then eventually bring\nthis drain internal to the body.\nBig operation.\nBut some great news is that advances\nin neurosurgical care\nhave allowed us to develop\nminimally invasive approaches\nto this surgery.\nThrough a small pinhole,\na camera can be inserted,\nled into the deep brain structure,\nand cause a little hole in a membrane\nthat allows all that fluid to drain,\nmuch like it would in a sink.\nAll of a sudden, the brain\nis no longer under pressure,\ncan re-expand\nand we cure the child\nthrough a single-hole incision.\n\n\n\n 8:55\n\n\nBut here's the problem:\nhydrocephalus is relatively rare.\nAnd there are no good training methods\nto get really good at getting\nthis scope to the right place.\nBut surgeons have been quite creative\nabout this, even our own.\nAnd they've come up with training models.\nHere's the current training model.\n\n\n\n 9:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:16\n\n\nI kid you not.\nThis is a red pepper,\nnot made in Hollywood;\nit's real red pepper.\nAnd what surgeons do is they stick\na scope into the pepper,\nand they do what is called a \"seedectomy.\"\n\n\n\n 9:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:29\n\n\nThey use this scope to remove seeds\nusing a little tweezer.\nAnd that is a way to get under their belts\nthe rudimentary components\nof doing this surgery.\nThen they head right into\nthe apprenticeship model,\nseeing many of them\nas they present themselves,\nthen doing it, and then teaching it —\nwaiting for these patients to arrive.\nWe can do a lot better.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nWe are manufacturing\nreproductions of children\nin order for surgeons and surgical\nteams to rehearse\nin the most relevant possible ways.\nLet me show you this.\nHere's my team\nin what's called the SIM Engineering\nDivision of the Simulator Program.\nThis is an amazing team of individuals.\nThey are mechanical engineers;\nyou're seeing here, illustrators.\nThey take primary data\nfrom CT scans and MRIs,\ntranslate it into digital information,\nanimate it,\nput it together into the components\nof the child itself,\nsurface-scan elements of the child\nthat have been casted as needed,\ndepending on the surgery itself,\nand then take this digital data\nand be able to output it\non state-of-the-art,\nthree-dimensional printing devices\nthat allow us to print the components\nexactly to the micron detail of what\nthe child's anatomy will look like.\nYou can see here,\nthe skull of this child being printed\nin the hours before\nwe performed this surgery.\n\n\n\n11:05\n\n\nBut we could not do this work\nwithout our dear friends on the West Coast\nin Hollywood, California.\nThese are individuals\nthat are incredibly talented\nat being able to recreate reality.\nIt was not a long leap for us.\nThe more we got into this field,\nthe more it became clear to us\nthat we are doing cinematography.\nWe're doing filmmaking,\nit's just that the actors are not actors.\nThey're real doctors and nurses.\nSo these are some photos\nof our dear friends at Fractured FX\nin Hollywood California,\nan Emmy-Award-winning\nspecial effects firm.\nThis is Justin Raleigh and his group —\nthis is not one of our patients —\n\n\n\n11:51\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:52\n\n\nbut kind of the exquisite work\nthat these individuals do.\nWe have now collaborated\nand fused our experience,\nbringing their group\nto Boston Children's Hospital,\nsending our group\nout to Hollywood, California\nand exchanging around this\nto be able to develop\nthese type of simulators.\n\n\n\n12:09\n\n\nWhat I'm about to show you\nis a reproduction of this child.\nYou'll notice here that every hair\non the child's head is reproduced.\nAnd in fact, this is also\nthat reproduced child —\nand I apologize for any queasy stomachs,\nbut that is a reproduction and simulation\nof the child they're about to operate on.\nHere's that membrane we had talked about,\nthe inside of this child's brain.\nWhat you're going to be seeing here\nis, on one side, the actual patient,\nand on the other side, the simulator.\nAs I mentioned, a scope, a little camera,\nneeds to make its way down,\nand you're seeing that here.\nIt needs to make a small hole\nin this membrane\nand allow this fluid to seep out.\nI won't do a quiz show to see\nwho thinks which side is which,\nbut on the right is the simulator.\n\n\n\n13:11\n\n\nSo surgeons can now produce\ntraining opportunities,\ndo these surgeries\nas many times as they want,\nto their heart's content,\nuntil they feel comfortable.\nAnd then, and only then,\nbring the child into the operating room.\nBut we don't stop here.\nWe know that a key step to this\nis not just the skill itself,\nbut combining that skill with a team\nwho's going to deliver that care.\n\n\n\n13:35\n\n\nNow we turn to Formula One.\nAnd here is an example\nof a technician putting on a tire\nand doing that time and time\nagain on this car.\nBut that is very quickly\ngoing to be incorporated\nwithin team-training experiences,\nnow as a full team orchestrating\nthe exchange of tires\nand getting this car back on the speedway.\nWe've done that step in health care,\nso now what you're about to see\nis a simulated operation.\nWe've taken the simulator\nI just described to you,\nwe've brought it into the operating room\nat Boston Children's Hospital,\nand these individuals —\nthese native teams, operative teams —\nare doing the surgery before the surgery.\nOperate twice;\ncut once.\nLet me show that to you.\n\n\n\n14:24\n\n\n(Video) Surgical team member 1:\nYou want the head down or head up?\n\n\n\n14:27\n\n\nSTM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?\n\n\n\n14:29\n\n\nSTM 3: And then lower\nthe whole table down a little bit?\n\n\n\n14:31\n\n\nSTM 4: Table coming

I'll be right in.\n\n\n\n14:44\n\n\nSTM 6: Great! Thank you.\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\nPeter Weinstock: It's really amazing.\nThe second step to this,\nwhich is critical,\nis we take these teams out\nimmediately and debrief them.\nWe use the same technologies\nthat are used in Lean\nand Six Sigma in the military,\nand we bring them out\nand talk about what went right,\nbut more importantly,\nwe talk about what didn't go well,\nand how we're going to fix it.\nThen we bring them right back in\nand do it again.\nDeliberative batting practice\nin the moments when it matters most.\n\n\n\n15:19\n\n\nLet's go back to this case now.\nSame child,\nbut now let me describe\nhow we care for this child\nat Boston Children's Hospital.\nThis child was born\nat three o'clock in the morning.\nAt two o'clock in the morning,\nwe assembled the team,\nand took the reproduced anatomy\nthat we would gain\nout of scans and images,\nand brought that team\nto the virtual bedside,\nto a simulated bedside —\nthe same team that's going to operate\non this child in the hours ahead —\nand we have them do the procedure.\nLet me show you a moment of this.\nThis is not a real incision.\nAnd the baby has not yet been born.\nImagine this.\n\n\n\n16:03\n\n\nSo now the conversations\nthat I have with families\nin the intensive care unit\nat Boston Children's Hospital\nare totally different.\nImagine this conversation:\n\"Not only do we take care of this disorder\nfrequently in our ICU,\nand not only have we done surgeries\nlike the surgery we're going\nto do on your child,\nbut we have done your child's surgery.\nAnd we did it two hours ago.\nAnd we did it 10 times.\nAnd now we're prepared to take them\nback to the operating room.\"\n\n\n\n16:39\n\n\nSo a new technology in health care:\nlifelike rehearsal.\nPracticing prior to game time.\n\n\n\n16:50\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nChris Anderson: So Robert\nspent the last few years\nthink about how weird human behavior is,\nand how inadequate most\nof our language trying to explain it is.\nAnd it's very exciting to hear him\nexplain some of the thinking behind it\nin public for the first time.\nOver to you now, Robert Sapolsky.\n\n\n\n 0:29\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 0:34\n\n\nRobert Sapolsky: Thank you.\nThe fantasy always runs\nsomething like this.\nI've overpowered his elite guard,\nburst into his secret bunker\nwith my machine gun ready.\nHe lunges for his Luger.\nI knock it out of his hand.\nHe lunges for his cyanide pill.\nI knock that out of his hand.\nHe snarls,\ncomes at me with otherworldly strength.\nWe grapple, we fight,\nI manage to pin him down\nand put on handcuffs.\n\"Adolf Hitler,\" I say,\n\"I arrest you for crimes\nagainst humanity.\"\n\n\n\n 1:09\n\n\nHere's where the Medal of Honor\nversion of the fantasy ends\nand the imagery darkens.\nWhat would I do if I had Hitler?\nIt's not hard to imagine\nonce I allow myself.\nSever his spine at the neck.\nTake out his eyes with a blunt instrument.\nPuncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.\nLeave him alive on a respirator,\ntube-fed, not able to speak\nor move or see or hear, just to feel,\nand then inject him\nwith something cancerous\nthat's going to fester and pustulate\nuntil every cell in his body\nis screaming in agony,\nuntil every second\nfeels like an eternity in hell.\nThat's what I would do to Hitler.\n\n\n\n 1:52\n\n\nI've had this fantasy since I was a kid,\nstill do sometimes,\nand when I do, my heart speeds up —\nall these plans for the most evil,\nwicked soul in history.\nBut there's a problem,\nwhich is I don't actually believe\nin souls or evil,\nand I think wicked belongs in a musical.\nBut there's some people\nI would like to see killed,\nbut I'm against the death penalty.\nBut I like schlocky violent movies,\nbut I'm for strict gun control.\nBut then there was a time\nI was at a laser tag place,\nand I had such a good time\nhiding in a corner shooting at people.\nIn other words, I'm your basic\nconfused human when it comes to violence.\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\nNow, as a species, we obviously\nhave problems with violence.\nWe use shower heads to deliver poison gas,\nletters with anthrax,\nairplanes as weapons,\nmass rape as a military strategy.\nWe're a miserably violent species.\nBut there's a complication,\nwhich is we don't hate violence,\nwe hate the wrong kind.\nAnd when it's the right kind,\nwe cheer it on, we hand out medals,\nwe vote for, we mate with\nour champions of it.\nWhen it's the right kind of violence,\nwe love it.\nAnd there's another complication,\nwhich is, in addition to us\nbeing this miserably violent species,\nwe're also this extraordinarily\naltruistic, compassionate one.\n\n\n\n 3:14\n\n\nSo how do you make sense\nof the biology of our best behaviors,\nour worst ones and all of those\nambiguously in between?\n\n\n\n 3:21\n\n\nNow, for starters,\nwhat's totally boring is understanding\nthe motoric aspects of the behavior.\nYour brain tells your spine,\ntells your muscles\nto do something or other,\nand hooray, you've behaved.\nWhat's hard is understanding\nthe meaning of the behavior,\nbecause in some settings,\npulling a trigger is an appalling act;\nin others, it's heroically\nself-sacrificial.\nIn some settings, putting your hand\none someone else's\nis deeply compassionate.\nIn others, it's a deep betrayal.\nThe challenge is to understand\nthe biology of the context\nof our behaviors,\nand that's real tough.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nOne thing that's clear, though,\nis you're not going to get anywhere\nif you think there's going to be\nthe brain region or the hormone\nor the gene or the childhood experience\nor the evolutionary mechanism\nthat explains everything.\nInstead, every bit of behavior\nhas multiple levels of causality.\n\n\n\n 4:17\n\n\nLet's look at an example.\nYou have a gun.\nThere's a crisis going on:\nrioting, violence, people running around.\nA stranger is running at you\nin an agitated state —\nyou can't quite tell if the expression\nis frightened, threatening, angry —\nholding something\nthat kind of looks like a handgun.\nYou're not sure.\nThe stranger comes running at you\nand you pull the trigger.\nAnd it turns out\nthat thing in this person's hand\nwas a cell phone.\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\nSo we asked this biological question:\nwhat was going on\nthat caused this behavior?\nWhat caused this behavior?\nAnd this is a multitude of questions.\n\n\n\n 4:56\n\n\nWe start.\nWhat was going on in your brain\none second before you pulled that trigger?\nAnd this brings us into the realm\nof a brain region called the amygdala.\nThe amygdala, which is\ncentral to violence, central to fear,\ninitiates volleys of cascades\nthat produce pulling of a trigger.\nWhat was the level of activity\nin your amygdala one second before?\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nBut to understand that,\nwe have to step back a little bit.\nWhat was going on in the environment\nseconds to minutes before\nthat impacted the amygdala?\nNow, obviously, the sights,\nthe sounds of the rioting,\nthat was pertinent.\nBut in addition,\nyou're more likely to mistake\na cell phone for a handgun\nif that stranger was male\nand large and of a different race.\nFurthermore, if you're in pain,\nif you're hungry, if you're exhausted,\nyour frontal cortex\nis not going to work as well,\npart of the brain whose job it is\nto get to the amygdala in time\nsaying, \"Are you really sure\nthat's a gun there?\"\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nBut we need to step further back.\nNow we have to look\nat hours to days before,\nand with this, we have entered\nthe realm of hormones.\nFor example, testosterone,\nwhere regardless of your sex,\nif you have elevated\ntestosterone levels in your blood,\nyou're more likely to think\na face with a neutral expression\nis instead looking threatening.\nElevated testosterone levels,\nelevated levels of stress hormones,\nand your amygdala\nis going to be more active\nand your frontal cortex\nwill be more sluggish.\n\n\n\n 6:28\n\n\nPushing back further,\nweeks to months before,\nwhere's the relevance there?\nThis is the realm of neural plasticity,\nthe fact that your brain\ncan change in response to experience,\nand if your previous months\nhave been filled with stress and trauma,\nyour amygdala will have enlarged.\nThe neurons will have become\nmore excitable,\nyour frontal cortex would have atrophied,\nall relevant to what happens\nin that one second.\n\n\n\n 6:53\n\n\nBut we push back even more, back years,\nback, for example, to your adolescence.\nNow, the central fact\nof the adolescent brain\nis all of it is going full blast\nexcept the frontal cortex,\nwhich is still half-baked.\nIt doesn't fully mature\nuntil you're around 25.\nAnd thus, adolescence and early adulthood\nare the years where environment\nand experience sculpt your frontal cortex\ninto the version you're going to have\nas an adult in that critical moment.\n\n\n\n 7:23\n\n\nBut pushing back even further,\neven further back\nto childhood and fetal life\nand all the different versions\nthat that could come in.\nNow, obviously, that's the time\nthat your brain is being constructed,\nand that's important,\nbut in addition,\nexperience during those times\nproduce what are called\nepigenetic changes,\npermanent, in some cases,\npermanently activating\ncertain genes, turning off others.\nAnd as an example of this,\nif as a fetus you were exposed to a lot\nof stress hormones through your mother,\nepigenetics is going to produce\nyour amygdala in adulthood\nas a more excitable form,\nand you're going to have\nelevated stress hormone levels.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\nBut pushing even further back,\nback to when you were just a fetus,\nback to when all you were\nwas a collection of genes.\nNow, genes are really\nimportant to all of this,\nbut critically, genes don't\ndetermine anything,\nbecause genes work differently\nin different environments.\nKey example here:\nthere's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,\nand if you have that variant,\nyou are far more likely\nto commit antisocial violence\nif, and only if,\nyou were abused as a child.\nGenes and environment interact,\nand what's happening in that one second\nbefore you pull that trigger\nreflects your lifetime\nof those gene-environment interactions.\n\n\n\n 8:45\n\n\nNow, remarkably enough,\nwe've got to push even further back now,\nback centuries.\nWhat were your ancestors up to.\nAnd if, for example,\nthey were nomadic pastoralists,\nthey were pastoralists,\npeople living in deserts or grasslands\nwith their herds of camels, cows, goats,\nodds are they would have invented\nwhat's called a culture of honor\nfilled with warrior classes,\nretributive violence, clan vendettas,\nand amazingly, centuries later,\nthat would still be influencing\nthe values with which you were raised.\n\n\n\n 9:18\n\n\nBut we've got to push even further back,\nback millions of years,\nbecause if we're talking about genes,\nimplicitly we're now talking\nabout the evolution of genes.\nAnd what you see is, for example,\npatterns across different primate species.\nSome of them have evolved\nfor extremely low levels of aggression,\nothers have evolved\nin the opposite direction,\nand floating there in between\nby every measure are humans,\nonce again this confused,\nbarely defined species\nthat has all these potentials\nto go one way or the other.\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\nSo what has this gotten us to?\nBasically, what we're seeing here is,\nif you want to understand a behavior,\nwhether it's an appalling one,\na wondrous one,\nor confusedly in between,\nif you want to understand that,\nyou've got take into account\nwhat happened a second before\nto a million years before,\neverything in between.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nSo what can we conclude at this point?\nOfficially, it's complicated.\nWow, that's really helpful.\nIt's complicated,\nand you'd better be\nreal careful, real cautious\nbefore you conclude\nyou know what causes a behavior,\nespecially if it's a behavior\nyou're judging harshly.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nNow, to me, the single most important\npoint about all of this\nis one having to do with change.\nEvery bit of biology I have mentioned here\ncan change in different circumstances.\nFor example, ecosystems change.\nThousands of years ago,\nthe Sahara was a lush grassland.\nCultures change.\nIn the 17th century, the most terrifying\npeople in Europe were the Swedes,\nrampaging all over the place.\nThis is what the Swedish\nmilitary does now.\nThey haven't had a war in 200 years.\nMost importantly,\nbrains change.\nNeurons grow new processes.\nCircuits disconnect.\nEverything in the brain changes,\nand out of this come extraordinary\nexamples of human change.\n\n\n\n11:16\n\n\nFirst one:\nthis is a man named John Newton,\na British theologian\nwho played a central role in the abolition\nof slavery from the British Empire\nin the early 1800s.\nAnd amazingly, this man\nspent decades as a younger man\nas the captain of a slave ship,\nand then as an investor in slavery,\ngrowing rich from this.\nAnd then something changed.\nSomething changed in him,\nsomething that Newton himself celebrated\nin the thing that he's most famous for,\na hymn that he wrote:\n\"Amazing Grace.\"\n\n\n\n11:54\n\n\nThis is a man named Zenji Abe\non the morning of December 6, 1941,\nabout to lead a squadron of Japanese\nbombers to attack Pearl Harbor.\nAnd this is the same man\n50 years later to the day\nhugging a man who survived\nthe attack on the ground.\nAnd as an old man,\nZenji Abe came to a collection\nof Pearl Harbor survivors\nat a ceremony there\nand in halting English apologized\nfor what he had done as a young man.\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nNow, it doesn't always require decades.\nSometimes, extraordinary change\ncould happen in just hours.\nConsider the World War I\nChristmas truce of 1914.\nThe powers that be\nhad negotiated a brief truce\nso that soldiers could go out,\ncollect bodies from no-man's-land\nin between the trench lines.\nAnd soon British and German soldiers\nwere doing that,\nand then helping each other carry bodies,\nand then helping each other\ndig graves in the frozen ground,\nand then praying together,\nand then having Christmas together\nand exchanging gifts,\nand by the next day,\nthey were playing soccer together\nand exchanging addresses\nso they could meet after the war.\nThat truce kept going\nuntil the officers had to arrive\nand said, \"We will shoot you\nunless you go back\nto trying to kill each other.\"\nAnd all it took here was hours\nfor these men to develop\na completely new category of \"us,\"\nall of us in the trenches here\non both sides, dying for no damn reason,\nand who is a \"them,\"\nthose faceless powers behind the lines\nwho were using them as pawns.\n\n\n\n13:29\n\n\nAnd sometimes,\nchange can occur in seconds.\nProbably the most horrifying event\nin the Vietnam War\nwas the My Lai Massacre.\nA brigade of American soldiers\nwent into an undefended\nvillage full of civilians\nand killed between 350 and 500 of them,\nmass-raped women and children,\nmutilated bodies.\nIt was appalling.\nIt was appalling because it occurred,\nbecause the government denied it,\nbecause the US government eventually\ndid nothing more than a slap on the wrist,\nand appalling because it almost certainly\nwas not a singular event.\nThis man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man\nwho stopped the My Lai Massacre.\nHe was piloting a helicopter gunship,\nlanded there, got out\nand saw American soldiers shooting babies,\nshooting old women,\nfigured out what was going on,\nand he then took his helicopter\nand did something that undid\nhis lifetime of conditioning\nas to who is an \"us\" and who is a \"them.\"\nHe landed his helicopter\nin between some surviving villagers\nand American soldiers\nand he trained his machine guns\non his fellow Americans,\nand said, \"If you don't stop the killing,\nI will mow you down.\"\n\n\n\n14:45\n\n\nNow, these people\nare no more special than any of us.\nSame neurons, same neurochemicals,\nsame biology.\nWhat we're left with here\nis this inevitable cliche:\n\"Those who don't study history\nare destined to repeat it.\"\nWhat we have here is the opposite of it.\nThose who don't study the history\nof extraordinary human change,\nthose who don't study the biology\nof what can transform us\nfrom our worst to our best behaviors,\nthose who don't do this\nare destined not to be able\nto repeat these incandescent,\nmagnificent moments.\n\n\n\n15:19\n\n\nSo thank you.\n\n\n\n15:21\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:31\n\n\nCA: Talks that really give you\na new mental model about something,\nthose are some of my favorite TED Talks,\nand we just got one.\nRobert, thank you so much for that.\nGood luck with the book.\nThat was amazing,\nand we're going to try and get you\nto come here in person one year.\nThank you so much.\n\n\n\n15:47\n\n\nRS: Thank you. Thank you all.\n\n"

Don't bathe.\"\n\n\n\n 3:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:14\n\n\nBoth Napoleon and Josephine\nadored violets.\nJosephine wore violet-scented perfume,\ncarried violets on their wedding day,\nand Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets\nevery year on their anniversary.\nWhen Josephine passed away,\nhe planted violets at her grave,\nand just before his exile,\nhe went back to that tomb site,\npicked some of those flowers,\nentombed them in a locket\nand wore them until the day he died.\n\n\n\n 3:37\n\n\nAnd I found this so moving,\nI thought, could I engineer that violet\nto smell just like Josephine?\nWhat if, for the rest of eternity,\nwhen you went to visit her site,\nyou could smell Josephine\njust as Napoleon loved her?\nCould we engineer new ways of mourning,\nnew rituals for remembering?\nAfter all, we've engineered\ntransgenic crops\nto be maximized for profit,\ncrops that stand up to transport,\ncrops that have a long shelf life,\ncrops that taste sugary sweet\nbut resist pests,\nsometimes at the expense\nof nutritional value.\nCan we harness these same technologies\nfor an emotionally sensitive output?\n\n\n\n 4:13\n\n\nSo currently in my lab,\nI'm researching questions like,\nwhat makes a human smell like a human?\nAnd it turns out it's fairly complicated.\nFactors such as your diet,\nyour medications, your lifestyle\nall factor into the way you smell.\nAnd I found that our sweat\nis mostly odorless,\nbut it's our bacteria and microbiome\nthat's responsible for your smells,\nyour mood, your identity\nand so much beyond.\nAnd there's all kinds\nof molecules that you emit\nbut which we only perceive subconsciously.\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nSo I've been cataloging and collecting\nbacteria from different sites of my body.\nAfter talking to a scientist, we thought,\nmaybe the perfect concoction of Ani\nis like 10 percent collarbone,\n30 percent underarm,\n40 percent bikini line and so forth,\nand occasionally\nI let researchers from other labs\ntake a sniff of my samples.\nAnd it's been interesting to hear\nhow smell of the body\nis perceived outside\nof the context of the body.\nI've gotten feedback such as,\nsmells like flowers, like chicken,\nlike cornflakes,\nlike beef carnitas.\n\n\n\n 5:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:16\n\n\nAt the same time, I cultivate\na set of carnivorous plants\nfor their ability to emit\nfleshlike odors to attract prey,\nin an attempt to kind of create\nthis symbiotic relationship\nbetween my bacteria and this organism.\nAnd as it so happens,\nI'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,\nand I was talking to a scientist\nwho happens to be a chemist\nand a plant scientist,\nand I was telling him about my project,\nand he was like, \"Well, this sounds\nlike botany for lonely women.\"\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\nUnperturbed, I said, \"OK.\"\nI challenged him.\n\"Can we engineer a plant\nthat can love me back?\"\nAnd for some reason,\nhe was like, \"Sure, why not?\"\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\nSo we started with,\ncan we get a plant to grow towards me\nlike I was the sun?\nAnd so we're looking at mechanisms\nin plants such as phototropism,\nwhich causes the plant\nto grow towards the sun\nby producing hormones like auxin,\nwhich causes cell elongation\non the shady side.\nAnd right now I'm creating\na set of lipsticks\nthat are infused with these chemicals\nthat allow me to interact with a plant\non its own chemical signatures —\nlipsticks that cause plants\nto grow where I kiss it,\nplants that blossom\nwhere I kiss the bloom.\n\n\n\n 6:26\n\n\nAnd through these projects,\nI'm asking questions like,\nhow do we define nature?\nHow do we define nature\nwhen we can reengineer its properties,\nand when should we do it?\nShould we do it for profit, for utility?\nCan we do it for emotional ends?\nCan biotechnology be used\nto create work as moving as music?\nWhat are the thresholds between science\nand its ability to shape\nour emotional landscape?\n\n\n\n 6:51\n\n\nIt's a famous design mantra\nthat form follows function.\nWell, now, wedged somewhere\nbetween science, design and art\nI get to ask,\nwhat if fiction informs fact?\nWhat kind of R&D lab would that look like\nand what kind of questions\nwould we ask together?\n\n\n\n 7:06\n\n\nWe often look to technology as the answer,\nbut as an artist and designer,\nI like to ask, but what is the question?\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 7:14\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIn the last couple of years,\nI have produced what I call\n\"The Dead Mall Series,\"\n32 short films and counting\nabout dead malls.\nNow, for those of you who are\nnot familiar with what a dead mall is,\nit's basically a shopping mall\nthat has fallen into hard times.\nSo it either has few shops\nand fewer shoppers,\nor it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.\nNo sale at Penny's.\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:39\n\n\nI started producing this series\nin early 2015\nafter going through\nkind of a dark period in my life\nwhere I just didn't want\nto create films anymore.\nI put my camera away\nand I just stopped.\nSo in 2015, I decided to make\na short film about the Owings Mills Mall.\nOwings Mills Mall opened in 1986.\nI should know because\nI was there on opening day.\nI was there with my family,\nalong with every other\nfamily in Baltimore,\nand you had to drive around\nfor 45 minutes\njust to find a parking spot.\nSo if you can imagine,\nthat's not happening at the malls today.\n\n\n\n 1:24\n\n\nMy first mall job that I had as a teenager\nwas at a sporting goods store\ncalled Herman's World of Sports.\nMaybe you remember.\n\n\n\n 1:33\n\n\n(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.\n\n\n\n 1:35\n\n\nYou guys remember that?\n\n\n\n 1:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:38\n\n\nYeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.\nI worked in a leather goods store,\nand I also worked in a video store,\nand not being one who was\nvery fond of the retail arts —\n\n\n\n 1:57\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:00\n\n\nI got fired from every single job.\n\n\n\n 2:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:05\n\n\nIn between these low-paying retail jobs,\nI did what any normal teenager did\nin the 1990s.\nI shoplifted.\nI'm just kidding.\nI hung out with my friends at the mall.\n\n\n\n 2:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nEveryone's like, \"Oh my God,\nwhat kind of talk is this?\"\n\n\n\n 2:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\nHanging out at the mall could be fun,\nbut it could be really lame, too,\nlike sharing a cigarette\nwith a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat\nwho has put on\nblack lipstick for the night\nwhile you're on your break\nfrom your crappy minimum wage job.\n\n\n\n 2:51\n\n\nAs I stand here today,\nOwings Mills has been gutted\nand it's ready for the wrecking ball.\nThe last time I was there,\nit was in the evening,\nand it was about three days\nbefore they closed the mall for good.\nAnd you kind of felt —\nthey never announced the mall was closing,\nbut you had this sort of feeling,\nthis ominous feeling,\nthat something big was going to happen,\nlike it was the end of the road.\nIt was a very creepy walk\nthrough the mall.\nLet me show you.\n\n\n\n 3:33\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nSo when I started producing\n\"The Dead Mall Series,\"\nI put the videos up onto YouTube,\nand while I thought they were interesting,\nfrankly I didn't think others\nwould share the enthusiasm\nfor such a drab and depressing topic.\nBut apparently I was wrong,\nbecause a lot of people\nstarted to comment.\nAnd at first the comments were like —\nbasically like, \"Oh my God,\nthat's the mall from my childhood.\nWhat happened?\"\nAnd then I would get comments\nfrom people who were like,\n\"There's a dead mall in my town.\nYou should come and film it.\"\nSo I started to travel around\nthe mid-Atlantic region\nfilming these dead malls.\nSome were open.\nSome were abandoned.\nIt was kind of always hard\nto get into the ones that were abandoned,\nbut I somehow always found a way in.\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:52\n\n\nThe malls that are still open,\nthey always do this weird thing —\nlike the dead malls.\nThey'll have three stores left,\nbut they try to spruce it up\nto make it appear\nlike things are on the up-and-up.\nFor example,\nyou'll have an empty store\nand they bring the gate down.\nSo at Owings Mills, for example,\nthey put this tarp over the gate.\nRight?\nAnd it's got a stock photo\nof a woman who is so happy\nand she's holding a blouse,\nand she's like —\n\n\n\n 5:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nAnd then there's a guy\nstanding next to her, with, like,\nan espresso cup, and he's like —\n\n\n\n 5:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:37\n\n\nAnd it says, \"What brings you today?\"\n\n\n\n 5:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\nI wanted to be scared and depressed.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nSo the comments just kept pouring in\non the videos,\nfrom all over the country,\nand then all over the world.\nAnd I started to think,\nthis could really be something,\nbut I had to get creative,\nbecause I'm like,\nhow long are people going to sit and watch\nme waddling through an empty mall?\n\n\n\n 6:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\nSo the original episodes\nI filmed with an iPhone.\nSo I'd walk through the mall\nwith an iPhone, and, you know.\nLike that.\n\n\n\n 6:26\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:27\n\n\nAnd security — because malls,\nthey don't like photography —\nso the security would come up and be like,\n\"Put that away,\" and I'm like, \"OK.\"\nSo I had to get creative and sneaky,\nso I started using a hidden camera\nand different techniques\nto get the footage that I needed,\nand basically what I wanted to do\nwas make the video\nlike it was a first-person experience,\nlike you are sitting —\nput your headphones on\nwatching the screen —\nit's like, you're there in the video,\nlike a video game, basically.\n\n\n\n 7:01\n\n\nI also started to use music,\ncollaborating with artists\nwho create music called vaporwave.\nAnd vaporwave is a music genre\nthat emerged in the early 2010s\namong internet communities.\nHere's an example.\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nThat's by an artist named Disconscious\nfrom an album he did\ncalled \"Hologram Plaza.\"\nSo if you look that up,\nyou can hear more of those tunes.\nVaporwave is more than an art form.\nIt's like a movement.\nIt's nihilistic, it's angsty,\nbut it's somehow comforting.\nThe whole aesthetic is a way of dealing\nwith things you can't do anything about,\nlike no jobs, or sitting in your parents'\nbasement eating ramen noodles.\nVaporwave came out of this generation's\ndesire to express their hopelessness,\nthe same way that\nthe pre-internet generation did\nsitting around in the food court.\n\n\n\n 8:28\n\n\nOne of my favorite malls\nI've been to\nis in Corpus Christi,\nand it's called the Sunrise Mall.\nWhen I was a kid,\nmy favorite thing to do was watch movies,\nand I used to watch movies\nover and over and over again.\nAnd one of my favorite films\nwas \"The Legend of Billie Jean.\"\nNow, for those of you who have seen\n\"The Legend of Billie Jean,\"\nyou'll know that it's a great film.\nI love it.\nAnd Helen Slater and Christian Slater —\nand if you didn't know,\nthey are not related.\nMany people thought that they\nwere brother and sister. They're not.\nBut anyway, Sunrise Mall was used\nin the film as a filming location.\nThe mall is exactly the same\nas it was in 1984.\nWe're talking 32 years later.\nLet me show you.\n\n\n\n 9:17\n\n\n(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean\nrunning across the fountain,\nbeing chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.\nAnd she jumps over here.\nAnd you can see the shot right here\nis what it looks like today.\nIt's pretty incredible.\nI mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.\nAnd there they are\nfalling in the fountain,\nand she runs up the stairs.\nThis is a nice shot\nof the whole thing here.\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\nDan Bell: I love that so much.\n\n\n\n 9:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:56\n\n\nI always think in my head,\nif I owned a dead mall —\nwhy don't they embrace their vintage look?\nPut in a bar,\nlike, put vegan food in the food court\nand invite millennials and hipsters\nto come and drink and eat,\nand I guarantee you within three weeks\nH&M and Levi's will be banging\non the door trying to get space.\nI don't know why they don't do this,\nbut apparently,\nit's only in my mind, it goes all day.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:33\n\n\nAnyway, in closing —\n\n\n\n10:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:38\n\n\nWhen they first asked me to do this talk,\nI said,\n\"Do you have the right person?\"\n\n\n\n10:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:50\n\n\nThese talks are supposed\nto be kind of inspiring and —\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:59\n\n\nI remembered something, though.\nI put my camera down\nthree or four years ago,\nand it took going to these malls\nfor me to be inspired again.\nAnd to see my audience\nand people from all over the world\nwriting me and saying,\n\"God, I love your videos,\"\nis incredible.\nI don't know how to even explain it,\nas an artist,\nhow fulfilling that is.\nIf you would have told me a year ago\nthat I would be standing on this stage\ntalking to all of you wonderful people,\nI would have never believed it.\nI am humbled\nand so appreciative.\n\n\n\n11:45\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n11:46\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:13\n\n\nHere's a question that matters.\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\n[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]\n\n\n\n 0:17\n\n\nBecause we're beginning to get all\nthe tools together to evolve ourselves.\nAnd we can evolve bacteria\nand we can evolve plants\nand we can evolve animals,\nand we're now reaching a point\nwhere we really have to ask,\nis it really ethical\nand do we want to evolve human beings?\nAnd as you're thinking about that,\nlet me talk about that\nin the context of prosthetics,\nprosthetics past, present, future.\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\nSo this is the iron hand\nthat belonged to one of the German counts.\nLoved to fight, lost his arm\nin one of these battles.\nNo problem, he just made a suit of armor,\nput it on,\nperfect prosthetic.\nThat's where the concept\nof ruling with an iron fist comes from.\n\n\n\n 1:00\n\n\nAnd of course these prosthetics\nhave been getting more and more useful,\nmore and more modern.\nYou can hold soft-boiled eggs.\nYou can have all types of controls,\nand as you're thinking about that,\nthere are wonderful people like Hugh Herr\nwho have been building\nabsolutely extraordinary prosthetics.\nSo the wonderful Aimee Mullins\nwill go out and say,\nhow tall do I want to be tonight?\nOr Hugh will say what type of cliff\ndo I want to climb?\nOr does somebody want to run a marathon,\nor does somebody want to ballroom dance?\nAnd as you adapt these things,\nthe interesting thing about prosthetics\nis they've been coming inside the body.\nSo these external prosthetics\nhave now become artificial knees.\nThey've become artificial hips.\nAnd then they've evolved further\nto become not just nice to have\nbut essential to have.\n\n\n\n 1:46\n\n\nSo when you're talking\nabout a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,\nyou're talking about something\nthat isn't just, \"I'm missing my leg,\"\nit's, \"if I don't have this, I can die.\"\nAnd at that point, a prosthetic\nbecomes a symbiotic relationship\nwith the human body.\n\n\n\n 2:03\n\n\nAnd four of the smartest people\nthat I've ever met —\nEd Boyden, Hugh Herr,\nJoe Jacobson, Bob Lander —\nare working on a Center\nfor Extreme Bionics.\nAnd the interesting thing\nof what you're seeing here is\nthese prosthetics\nnow get integrated into the bone.\nThey get integrated into the skin.\nThey get integrated into the muscle.\nAnd one of the other sides of Ed\nis he's been thinking\nabout how to connect the brain\nusing light or other mechanisms\ndirectly to things like these prosthetics.\nAnd if you can do that,\nthen you can begin changing\nfundamental aspects of humanity.\nSo how quickly you react to something\ndepends on the diameter of a nerve.\nAnd of course, if you have nerves\nthat are external or prosthetic,\nsay with light or liquid metal,\nthen you can increase that diameter\nand you could even increase it\ntheoretically to the point where,\nas long as you could see the muzzle flash,\nyou could step out of the way of a bullet.\nThose are the order of magnitude\nof changes you're talking about.\n\n\n\n 3:07\n\n\nThis is a fourth\nsort of level of prosthetics.\nThese are Phonak hearing aids,\nand the reason\nwhy these are so interesting\nis because they cross the threshold\nfrom where prosthetics are something\nfor somebody who is \"disabled\"\nand they become something\nthat somebody who is \"normal\"\nmight want to actually have,\nbecause what this prosthetic does,\nwhich is really interesting,\nis not only does it help you hear,\nyou can focus your hearing,\nso it can hear the conversation\ngoing on over there.\nYou can have superhearing.\nYou can have hearing in 360 degrees.\nYou can have white noise.\nYou can record, and oh, by the way,\nthey also put a phone into this.\nSo this functions as your hearing aid\nand also as your phone.\nAnd at that point, somebody might actually\nwant to have a prosthetic voluntarily.\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nAll of these thousands\nof loosely connected little pieces\nare coming together,\nand it's about time we ask the question,\nhow do we want to evolve human beings\nover the next century or two?\nAnd for that we turn\nto a great philosopher\nwho was a very smart man\ndespite being a Yankee fan.\n\n\n\n 4:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:13\n\n\nAnd Yogi Berra used to say, of course,\nthat it's very tough to make predictions,\nespecially about the future.\n\n\n\n 4:19\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:20\n\n\nSo instead of making a prediction\nabout the future to begin with,\nlet's take what's happening in the present\nwith people like Tony Atala,\nwho is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.\nAnd maybe the ultimate prosthetic\nisn't having something external, titanium.\nMaybe the ultimate prosthetic\nis take your own gene code,\nremake your own body parts,\nbecause that's a whole lot more effective\nthan any kind of a prosthetic.\nBut while you're at it, then you can take\nthe work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.\nAnd one of the things\nthat we've been doing\nis trying to figure out\nhow to reprogram cells.\nAnd if you can reprogram a cell,\nthen you can change the cells\nin those organs.\nSo if you can change\nthe cells in those organs,\nmaybe you make those organs\nmore radiation-resistant.\nMaybe you make them absorb more oxygen.\nMaybe you make them more efficient\nto filter out stuff\nthat you don't want in your body.\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\nAnd over the last few weeks,\nGeorge Church has been in the news a lot\nbecause he's been talking about taking\none of these programmable cells\nand inserting an entire human genome\ninto that cell.\nAnd once you can insert\nan entire human genome into a cell,\nthen you begin to ask the question,\nwould you want\nto enhance any of that genome?\nDo you want to enhance a human body?\nHow would you want\nto enhance a human body?\nWhere is it ethical\nto enhance a human body\nand where is it not ethical\nto enhance a human body?\nAnd all of a sudden, what we're doing\nis we've got this\nmultidimensional chess board\nwhere we can change\nhuman genetics by using viruses\nto attack things like AIDS,\nor we can change the gene code\nthrough gene therapy\nto do away with some hereditary diseases,\nor we can change the environment,\nand change the expression\nof those genes in the epigenome\nand pass that on to the next generations.\nAnd all of a sudden,\nit's not just one little bit,\nit's all these stacked little bits\nthat allow you\nto take little portions of it\nuntil all the portions coming together\nlead you to something\nthat's very different.\n\n\n\n 6:20\n\n\nAnd a lot of people\nare very scared by this stuff.\nAnd it does sound scary,\nand there are risks to this stuff.\nSo why in the world would you\never want to do this stuff?\nWhy would we really want\nto alter the human body\nin a fundamental way?\n\n\n\n 6:36\n\n\nThe answer lies in part\nwith Lord Rees,\nastronomer royal of Great Britain.\nAnd one of his favorite sayings\nis the universe is 100 percent malevolent.\nSo what does that mean?\nIt means if you take\nany one of your bodies at random,\ndrop it anywhere in the universe,\ndrop it in space, you die.\nDrop it on the Sun, you die.\nDrop it on the surface\nof Mercury, you die.\nDrop it near a supernova, you die.\nBut fortunately, it's only\nabout 80 percent effective.\n\n\n\n 7:05\n\n\nSo as a great physicist once said,\nthere's these little\nupstream eddies of biology\nthat create order\nin this rapid torrent of entropy.\nSo as the universe dissipates energy,\nthere's these upstream eddies\nthat create biological order.\nNow, the problem with eddies is,\nthey tend to disappear.\nThey shift. They move in rivers.\nAnd because of that, when an eddy shifts,\nwhen the Earth becomes a snowball,\nwhen the Earth becomes very hot,\nwhen the Earth gets hit by an asteroid,\nwhen you have supervolcanoes,\nwhen you have solar flares,\nwhen you have potentially\nextinction-level events\nlike the next election —\n\n\n\n 7:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:52\n\n\nthen all of a sudden,\nyou can have periodic extinctions.\nAnd by the way, that's happened\nfive times on Earth,\nand therefore it is very likely\nthat the human species on Earth\nis going to go extinct someday.\nNot next week,\nnot next month,\nmaybe in November,\nbut maybe 10,000 years after that.\nAs you're thinking\nof the consequence of that,\nif you believe that extinctions\nare common and natural\nand normal and occur periodically,\nit becomes a moral imperative\nto diversify our species.\n\n\n\n 8:25\n\n\nAnd it becomes a moral imperative\nbecause it's going to be\nreally hard to live on Mars\nif we don't fundamentally\nmodify the human body.\nRight?\nYou go from one cell,\nmom and dad coming together\nto make one cell,\nin a cascade to 10 trillion cells.\nWe don't know, if you change\nthe gravity substantially,\nif the same thing will happen\nto create your body.\nWe do know that if you expose\nour bodies as they currently are\nto a lot of radiation, we will die.\nSo as you're thinking of that,\nyou have to really redesign things\njust to get to Mars.\nForget about the moons\nof Neptune or Jupiter.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nAnd to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,\nlet's think about life\nin a series of scales.\nSo Life One civilization\nis a civilization that begins\nto alter his or her looks.\nAnd we've been doing that\nfor thousands of years.\nYou've got tummy tucks\nand you've got this and you've got that.\nYou alter your looks, and I'm told\nthat not all of those alterations\ntake place for medical reasons.\n\n\n\n 9:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:29\n\n\nSeems odd.\n\n\n\n 9:31\n\n\nA Life Two civilization\nis a different civilization.\nA Life Two civilization alters\nfundamental aspects of the body.\nSo you put human growth hormone in,\nthe person grows taller,\nor you put x in and the person\ngets fatter or loses metabolism\nor does a whole series of things,\nbut you're altering the functions\nin a fundamental way.\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\nTo become an intrasolar civilization,\nwe're going to have to create\na Life Three civilization,\nand that looks very different\nfrom what we've got here.\nMaybe you splice in\nDeinococcus radiodurans\nso that the cells can resplice\nafter a lot of exposure to radiation.\nMaybe you breathe by having oxygen\nflow through your blood\ninstead of through your lungs.\nBut you're talking about\nreally radical redesigns,\nand one of the interesting things\nthat's happened in the last decade\nis we've discovered\na whole lot of planets out there.\nAnd some of them may be Earth-like.\nThe problem is, if we ever\nwant to get to these planets,\nthe fastest human objects —\nJuno and Voyager\nand the rest of this stuff —\ntake tens of thousands of years\nto get from here\nto the nearest solar system.\nSo if you want to start exploring\nbeaches somewhere else,\nor you want to see two-sun sunsets,\nthen you're talking\nabout something that is very different,\nbecause you have to change\nthe timescale and the body of humans\nin ways which may be\nabsolutely unrecognizable.\nAnd that's a Life Four civilization.\n\n\n\n11:04\n\n\nNow, we can't even begin\nto imagine what that might look like,\nbut we're beginning to get glimpses\nof instruments that might\ntake us even that far.\nAnd let me give you two examples.\n\n\n\n11:15\n\n\nSo this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,\nand one of the things\nthat Floyd's been doing\nis he's been playing\nwith the basic chemistry of life.\nSo all life on this planet\nis made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.\nAll bacteria, all plants,\nall animals, all humans, all cows,\neverything else.\nAnd what Floyd did is he changed out\ntwo of those base pairs,\nso it's ATXY.\nAnd that means that you now have\na parallel system to make life,\nto make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,\nthat doesn't mate\nwith most things on Earth\nor in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.\nMaybe you make plants\nthat are immune to all bacteria.\nMaybe you make plants\nthat are immune to all viruses.\nBut why is that so interesting?\nIt means that we\nare not a unique solution.\nIt means you can create\nalternate chemistries to us\nthat could be chemistries\nadaptable to a very different planet\nthat could create life and heredity.\n\n\n\n12:19\n\n\nThe second experiment,\nor the other implication\nof this experiment,\nis that all of you, all life\nis based on 20 amino acids.\nIf you don't substitute two amino acids,\nif you don't say ATXY,\nif you say ATCG + XY,\nthen you go from\n20 building blocks to 172,\nand all of a sudden you've got\n172 building blocks of amino acids\nto build life-forms\nin very different shapes.\n\n\n\n12:48\n\n\nThe second experiment to think about\nis a really weird experiment\nthat's been taking place in China.\nSo this guy has been transplanting\nhundreds of mouse heads.\nRight?\nAnd why is that an interesting experiment?\nWell, think of the first\nheart transplants.\nOne of the things they used to do\nis they used to bring in\nthe wife or the daughter of the donor\nso the donee could tell the doctors,\n\"Do you recognize this person?\nDo you love this person?\nDo you feel anything for this person?\"\nWe laugh about that today.\nWe laugh because we know\nthe heart is a muscle,\nbut for hundreds of thousands of years,\nor tens of thousands of years,\n\"I gave her my heart.\nShe took my heart. She broke my heart.\"\nWe thought this was emotion\nand we thought maybe emotions\nwere transplanted with the heart. Nope.\n\n\n\n13:37\n\n\nSo how about the brain?\nTwo possible outcomes to this experiment.\nIf you can get a mouse\nthat is functional,\nthen you can see,\nis the new brain a blank slate?\nAnd boy, does that have implications.\nSecond option:\nthe new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.\nThe new mouse\nremembers what it's afraid of,\nremembers how to navigate the maze,\nand if that is true,\nthen you can transplant\nmemory and consciousness.\nAnd then the really\ninteresting question is,\nif you can transplant this,\nis the only input-output mechanism\nthis down here?\nOr could you transplant\nthat consciousness into something\nthat would be very different,\nthat would last in space,\nthat would last\ntens of thousands of years,\nthat would be a completely redesigned body\nthat could hold consciousness\nfor a long, long period of time?\n\n\n\n14:37\n\n\nAnd let's come back to the first question:\nWhy would you ever want to do that?\nWell, I'll tell you why.\nBecause this is the ultimate selfie.\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:49\n\n\nThis is taken from six billion miles away,\nand that's Earth.\nAnd that's all of us.\nAnd if that little thing goes,\nall of humanity goes.\nAnd the reason you want\nto alter the human body\nis because you eventually\nwant a picture that says,\nthat's us, and that's us,\nand that's us,\nbecause that's the way humanity\nsurvives long-term extinction.\nAnd that's the reason why it turns out\nit's actually unethical\nnot to evolve the human body\neven though it can be scary,\neven though it can be challenging,\nbut it's what's going\nto allow us to explore, live\nand get to places\nwe can't even dream of today,\nbut which our great-great-great-great-\ngrandchildren might someday.\n\n\n\n15:36\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n15:37\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nCode is the next universal language.\nIn the seventies, it was punk music\nthat drove the whole generation.\nIn the eighties, it was probably money.\nBut for my generation of people,\nsoftware is the interface\nto our imagination and our world.\nAnd that means that we need\na radically, radically\nmore diverse set of people\nto build those products,\nto not see computers as mechanical\nand lonely and boring and magic,\nto see them as things\nthat they can tinker\nand turn around and twist,\nand so forth.\n\n\n\n 0:46\n\n\nMy personal journey into the world\nof programming and technology\nstarted at the tender age of 14.\nI had this mad teenage crush\non an older man,\nand the older man in question\njust happened to be\nthe then Vice President\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore.\nAnd I did what every single\nteenage girl would want to do.\nI wanted to somehow\nexpress all of this love,\nso I built him a website, it's over here.\nAnd in 2001, there was no Tumblr,\nthere was no Facebook,\nthere was no Pinterest.\nSo I needed to learn to code\nin order to express\nall of this longing and loving.\n\n\n\n 1:23\n\n\nAnd that is how programming\nstarted for me.\nIt started as a means of self-expression.\nJust like when I was smaller,\nI would use crayons and legos.\nAnd when I was older, I would use\nguitar lessons and theater plays.\nBut then, there were other things\nto get excited about,\nlike poetry and knitting socks\nand conjugating French irregular verbs\nand coming up with make-believe worlds\nand Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.\nAnd I started to be one of those people\nwho felt that computers\nare boring and technical and lonely.\n\n\n\n 1:57\n\n\nHere's what I think today.\nLittle girls don't know that they\nare not supposed to like computers.\nLittle girls are amazing.\nThey are really, really good\nat concentrating on things\nand being exact and they ask\namazing questions like,\n\"What?\" and \"Why?\"\nand \"How?\" and \"What if?\"\nAnd they don't know that they\nare not supposed to like computers.\nIt's the parents who do.\nIt's us parents who feel\nlike computer science\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline\nthat only belongs to the mystery makers.\nThat it's almost as far removed\nfrom everyday life\nas, say, nuclear physics.\n\n\n\n 2:36\n\n\nAnd they are partly right about that.\nThere's a lot of syntax\nand controls and data structures\nand algorithms and practices,\nprotocols and paradigms in programming.\nAnd we as a community,\nwe've made computers smaller and smaller.\nWe've built layers and layers\nof abstraction on top of each other\nbetween the man and the machine\nto the point that we no longer\nhave any idea how computers work\nor how to talk to them.\nAnd we do teach our kids\nhow the human body works,\nwe teach them how\nthe combustion engine functions\nand we even tell them\nthat if you want to really be an astronaut\nyou can become one.\nBut when the kid comes to us and asks,\n\"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\"\nOr, \"How does the computer know\nwhat happens when I press 'play,'\nhow does it know which video to show?\"\nOr, \"Linda, is Internet a place?\"\nWe adults, we grow oddly silent.\n\"It's magic,\" some of us say.\n\"It's too complicated,\" the others say.\n\n\n\n 3:37\n\n\nWell, it's neither.\nIt's not magic and it's not complicated.\nIt all just happened\nreally, really, really fast.\nComputer scientists built\nthese amazing, beautiful machines,\nbut they made them\nvery, very foreign to us,\nand also the language we speak\nto the computers\nso that we don't know\nhow to speak to the computers anymore\nwithout our fancy user interfaces.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nAnd that's why no one recognized\nthat when I was conjugating\nFrench irregular verbs,\nI was actually practicing\nmy pattern recognition skills.\nAnd when I was excited about knitting,\nI actually was following\na sequence of symbolic commands\nthat included loops inside of them.\nAnd that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest\nto find an exact language\nbetween English and mathematics\nfound its home inside of a computer.\nI was a programmer, but no one knew it.\n\n\n\n 4:26\n\n\nThe kids of today, they tap, swipe\nand pinch their way through the world.\nBut unless we give them tools\nto build with computers,\nwe are raising only consumers\ninstead of creators.\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nThis whole quest\nled me to this little girl.\nHer name is Ruby, she is six years old.\nShe is completely fearless,\nimaginative and a little bit bossy.\nAnd every time\nI would run into a problem\nin trying to teach\nmyself programming like,\n\"What is object-oriented design\nor what is garbage collection?\",\nI would try to imagine how a six-year-old\nlittle girl would explain the problem.\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\nAnd I wrote a book about her\nand I illustrated it\nand the things\nRuby taught me go like this.\nRuby taught me that you're\nnot supposed to be afraid\nof the bugs under your bed.\nAnd even the biggest of the problems\nare a group of tiny problems\nstuck together.\nAnd Ruby also introduced\nme to her friends,\nthe colorful side of the Internet culture.\nShe has friends like the Snow Leopard,\nwho is beautiful but doesn't want\nto play with the other kids.\nAnd she has friends like the green robots\nthat are really friendly but super messy.\nAnd she has friends like Linux the penguin\nwho's really ruthlessly efficient,\nbut somewhat hard to understand.\nAnd idealistic foxes, and so on.\n\n\n\n 5:38\n\n\nIn Ruby's world, you learn\ntechnology through play.\nAnd, for instance, computers\nare really good at repeating stuff,\nso the way Ruby would teach\nloops goes like this.\nThis is Ruby's favorite dance move,\nit goes, \"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp\nclap, clap and jump.\"\nAnd you learn counter loops\nby repeating that four times.\nAnd you learn while loops\nby repeating that sequence\nwhile I'm standing on one leg.\nAnd you learn until loops\nby repeating that sequence\nuntil mom gets really mad.\n(Laughter)\nAnd most of all, you learn\nthat there are no ready answers.\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\nWhen coming up with the curriculum\nfor Ruby's world,\nI needed to really ask the kids\nhow they see the world\nand what kind of questions they have\nand I would organize\nplay testing sessions.\nI would start by showing the kids\nthese four pictures.\nI would show them a picture of a car,\na grocery store, a dog and a toilet.\nAnd I would ask, \"Which one of these\ndo you think is a computer?\"\nAnd the kids would be\nvery conservative and go,\n\"None of these is a computer.\nI know what a computer is:\nit's that glowing box\nin front of which mom or dad\nspends way too much time.\"\nBut then we would talk\nand we would discover\nthat actually, a car is a computer,\nit has a navigation system inside of it.\nAnd a dog — a dog\nmight not be a computer,\nbut it has a collar\nand the collar might have\na computer inside of it.\nAnd grocery stores, they have\nso many different kinds of computers,\nlike the cashier system\nand the burglar alarms.\nAnd kids, you know what?\nIn Japan, toilets are computers\nand there's even hackers who hack them.\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\nAnd we go further\nand I give them these little stickers\nwith an on/off button on them.\nAnd I tell the kids,\n\"Today you have this magic ability\nto make anything in this room\ninto a computer.\"\nAnd again, the kids go,\n\"Sounds really hard,\nI don't know the right answer for this.\"\nBut I tell them, \"Don't worry,\nyour parents don't know\nthe right answer, either.\nThey've just started\nto hear about this thing\ncalled The Internet of Things.\nBut you kids,\nyou are going to be the ones\nwho are really going to live up in a world\nwhere everything is a computer.\"\n\n\n\n 7:46\n\n\nAnd then I had this little girl\nwho came to me\nand took a bicycle lamp\nand she said, \"This bicycle lamp,\nif it were a computer,\nit would change colors.\"\nAnd I said, \"That's a really good idea,\nwhat else could it do?\"\nAnd she thinks and she thinks,\nand she goes, \"If this bicycle lamp\nwere a computer,\nwe could go on a biking trip\nwith my father\nand we would sleep in a tent\nand this biking lamp\ncould also be a movie projector.\"\nAnd that's the moment I'm looking for,\nthe moment when the kid realizes\nthat the world\nis definitely not ready yet,\nthat a really awesome way\nof making the world more ready\nis by building technology\nand that each one of us\ncan be a part of that change.\n\n\n\n 8:30\n\n\nFinal story, we also built a computer.\nAnd we got to know the bossy CPU\nand the helpful RAM and ROM\nthat help it remember things.\nAnd after we've assembled\nour computer together,\nwe also design an application for it.\nAnd my favorite story is this little boy,\nhe's six years old\nand his favorite thing in the world\nis to be an astronaut.\nAnd the boy, he has\nthese huge headphones on\nand he's completely immersed\nin his tiny paper computer\nbecause you see, he's built his own\nintergalactic planetary\nnavigation application.\nAnd his father, the lone astronaut\nin the Martian orbit,\nis on the other side of the room\nand the boy's important mission\nis to bring the father\nsafely back to earth.\nAnd these kids are going to have\na profoundly different view of the world\nand the way we build it with technology.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nFinally, the more approachable,\nthe more inclusive,\nand the more diverse\nwe make the world of technology,\nthe more colorful and better\nthe world will look like.\nSo, imagine with me, for a moment,\na world where the stories we tell\nabout how things get made\ndon't only include\nthe twentysomething-year-old\nSilicon Valley boys,\nbut also Kenyan schoolgirls\nand Norwegian librarians.\nImagine a world where\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,\nwho live in a permanent\nreality of 1s and 0s,\nthey grow up to be very optimistic\nand brave about technology.\nThey embrace the powers\nand the opportunities\nand the limitations of the world.\nA world of technology\nthat is wonderful, whimsical\nand a tiny bit weird.\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\nWhen I was a girl,\nI wanted to be a storyteller.\nI loved make-believe worlds\nand my favorite thing to do\nwas to wake up in the mornings\nin Moominvalley.\nIn the afternoons,\nI would roam around the Tatooines.\nAnd in the evenings,\nI would go to sleep in Narnia.\nAnd programming turned out\nto be the perfect profession for me.\nI still create worlds.\nInstead of stories, I do them with code.\n\n\n\n10:42\n\n\nProgramming gives me this amazing power\nto build my whole little universe\nwith its own rules\nand paradigms and practices.\nCreate something out of nothing\nwith the pure power of logic.\n\n\n\n10:57\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n10:59\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI, like many of you,\nam one of the two billion people\non Earth who live in cities.\nAnd there are days —\nI don't know about the rest of you —\nbut there are days when I palpably feel\nhow much I rely on other people\nfor pretty much everything in my life.\nAnd some days, that can even\nbe a little scary.\nBut what I'm here\nto talk to you about today\nis how that same interdependence\nis actually an extremely\npowerful social infrastructure\nthat we can actually harness\nto help heal some\nof our deepest civic issues,\nif we apply open-source collaboration.\n\n\n\n 0:55\n\n\nA couple of years ago,\nI read an article by New York Times\nwriter Michael Pollan,\nin which he argued that growing\neven some of our own food\nis one of the best things\nthat we can do for the environment.\nNow at the time that I was reading this,\nit was the middle of the winter\nand I definitely did not have room\nfor a lot of dirt\nin my New York City apartment.\nSo I was basically just willing to settle\nfor just reading the next Wired magazine\nand finding out how the experts\nwere going to figure out\nhow to solve all these problems\nfor us in the future.\nBut that was actually exactly the point\nthat Michael Pollan\nwas making in this article —\nit's precisely when we hand over\nthe responsibility\nfor all these things to specialists\nthat we cause the kind of messes\nthat we see with the food system.\n\n\n\n 1:43\n\n\nSo, I happen to know\na little bit from my own work\nabout how NASA has been using hydroponics\nto explore growing food in space.\nAnd that you can actually\nget optimal nutritional yield\nby running a kind of high-quality\nliquid soil over plants' root systems.\nNow to a vegetable plant,\nmy apartment has got to be\nabout as foreign as outer space.\nBut I can offer some natural light\nand year-round climate control.\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nFast-forward two years later:\nwe now have window farms,\nwhich are vertical, hydroponic platforms\nfor food-growing indoors.\nAnd the way it works\nis that there's a pump at the bottom,\nwhich periodically sends this liquid\nnutrient solution up to the top,\nwhich then trickles down\nthrough plants' root systems\nthat are suspended in clay pellets —\nso there's no dirt involved.\nNow light and temperature vary\nwith each window's microclimate,\nso a window farm requires a farmer,\nand she must decide\nwhat kind of crops she is going\nto put in her window farm,\nand whether she is going\nto feed her food organically.\n\n\n\n 2:56\n\n\nBack at the time,\na window farm was no more\nthan a technically complex idea\nthat was going to require\na lot of testing.\nAnd I really wanted it\nto be an open project,\nbecause hydroponics\nis one of the fastest\ngrowing areas of patenting\nin the United States right now,\nand could possibly become\nanother area like Monsanto,\nwhere we have a lot of corporate\nintellectual property\nin the way of people's food.\nSo I decided that,\ninstead of creating a product,\nwhat I was going to do\nwas open this up\nto a whole bunch of codevelopers.\n\n\n\n 3:30\n\n\nThe first few systems that we created,\nthey kind of worked.\nWe were actually able to grow\nabout a salad a week\nin a typical New York City\napartment window.\nAnd we were able to grow cherry tomatoes\nand cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.\nBut the first few systems\nwere these leaky, loud power-guzzlers\nthat Martha Stewart\nwould definitely never have approved.\n\n\n\n 3:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:51\n\n\nSo to bring on more codevelopers,\nwhat we did was we created\na social media site\non which we published the designs,\nwe explained how they worked,\nand we even went so far\nas to point out everything\nthat was wrong with these systems.\nAnd then we invited people\nall over the world\nto build them and experiment with us.\nSo actually now on this website,\nwe have 18,000 people.\nAnd we have window farms\nall over the world.\n\n\n\n 4:21\n\n\nWhat we're doing\nis what NASA or a large corporation\nwould call R&D,\nor research and development.\nBut what we call it is R&D-I-Y,\nor \"research and develop it yourself.\"\n\n\n\n 4:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\nSo, for example, Jackson came along\nand suggested that we use air pumps\ninstead of water pumps.\nIt took building a whole bunch\nof systems to get it right,\nbut once we did, we were able to cut\nour carbon footprint nearly in half.\nTony in Chicago has been taking on\ngrowing experiments,\nlike lots of other window farmers,\nand he's been able to get\nhis strawberries to fruit\nfor nine months of the year\nin low-light conditions\nby simply changing out\nthe organic nutrients.\nAnd window farmers in Finland\nhave been customizing their window farms\nfor the dark days of the Finnish winters\nby outfitting them with LED grow lights\nthat they're now making\nopen source and part of the project.\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\nSo window farms have been evolving\nthrough a rapid versioning process\nsimilar to software.\nAnd with every open source project,\nthe real benefit is the interplay\nbetween the specific concerns\nof people customizing their systems\nfor their own particular concerns,\nand the universal concerns.\nSo my core team and I\nare able to concentrate\non the improvements\nthat really benefit everyone.\nAnd we're able to look out\nfor the needs of newcomers.\n\n\n\n 5:44\n\n\nSo for do-it-yourselfers,\nwe provide free,\nvery well-tested instructions\nso that anyone, anywhere around the world,\ncan build one of these systems for free.\nAnd there's a patent pending\non these systems as well\nthat's held by the community.\nAnd to fund the project,\nwe partner to create products\nthat we then sell\nto schools and to individuals\nwho don't have time\nto build their own systems.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nNow within our community,\na certain culture has appeared.\nIn our culture,\nit is better to be a tester\nwho supports someone else's idea\nthan it is to be just the idea guy.\nWhat we get out of this project\nis support for our own work,\nas well as an experience\nof actually contributing\nto the environmental movement\nin a way other than just\nscrewing in new light bulbs.\nBut I think that Eleen expresses best\nwhat we really get out of this,\nwhich is the actual joy of collaboration.\nSo she expresses here what it's like\nto see someone halfway across the world\nhaving taken your idea, built upon it\nand then acknowledging\nyou for contributing.\nIf we really want to see\nthe kind of wide consumer behavior change\nthat we're all talking about\nas environmentalists and food people,\nmaybe we just need\nto ditch the term \"consumer\"\nand get behind the people\nwho are doing stuff.\n\n\n\n 7:06\n\n\nOpen source projects\ntend to have a momentum of their own.\nAnd what we're seeing is that R&D-I-Y\nhas moved beyond\njust window farms and LEDs\ninto solar panels and aquaponic systems.\nAnd we're building upon innovations\nof generations who went before us.\nAnd we're looking ahead at generations\nwho really need us\nto retool our lives now.\nSo we ask that you join us\nin rediscovering the value\nof citizens united,\nand to declare\nthat we are all still pioneers.\n\n\n\n 7:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nIf you're here today —\nand I'm very happy that you are —\nyou've all heard about\nhow sustainable development\nwill save us from ourselves.\nHowever, when we're not at TED,\nwe are often told\nthat a real sustainability policy agenda\nis just not feasible,\nespecially in large urban areas\nlike New York City.\nAnd that's because most people\nwith decision-making powers,\nin both the public and the private sector,\nreally don't feel\nas though they're in danger.\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\nThe reason why I'm here today,\nin part, is because of a dog —\nan abandoned puppy I found\nback in the rain, back in 1998.\nShe turned out to be\na much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.\nWhen she came into my life, we were\nfighting against a huge waste facility\nplanned for the East River waterfront\ndespite the fact that\nour small part of New York City\nalready handled more than 40 percent\nof the entire city's commercial waste:\na sewage treatment pelletizing plant,\na sewage sludge plant, four power plants,\nthe world's largest\nfood-distribution center,\nas well as other industries that bring\nmore than 60,000 diesel truck trips\nto the area each week.\nThe area also has one of the lowest ratios\nof parks to people in the city.\n\n\n\n 1:20\n\n\nSo when I was contacted\nby the Parks Department\nabout a $10,000 seed-grant initiative\nto help develop waterfront projects,\nI thought they were really\nwell-meaning, but a bit naive.\nI'd lived in this area all my life,\nand you could not get to the river,\nbecause of all the lovely facilities\nthat I mentioned earlier.\nThen, while jogging\nwith my dog one morning,\nshe pulled me into what I thought\nwas just another illegal dump.\nThere were weeds and piles of garbage\nand other stuff that I won't mention here,\nbut she kept dragging me,\nand lo and behold, at the end\nof that lot was the river.\nI knew that this forgotten\nlittle street-end,\nabandoned like the dog that brought\nme there, was worth saving.\nAnd I knew it would grow\nto become the proud beginnings\nof the community-led revitalization\nof the new South Bronx.\n\n\n\n 2:01\n\n\nAnd just like my new dog, it was an idea\nthat got bigger than I'd imagined.\nWe garnered much support along the way,\nand the Hunts Point Riverside Park\nbecame the first waterfront park\nthat the South Bronx had had\nin more than 60 years.\nWe leveraged that $10,000 seed grant\nmore than 300 times,\ninto a $3 million park.\n\n\n\n 2:18\n\n\nAnd in the fall, I'm going to exchange\nmarriage vows with my beloved.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\n(Audience whistles)\n\n\n\n 2:24\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n 2:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:30\n\n\nThat's him pressing my buttons\nback there, which he does all the time.\n\n\n\n 2:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:36\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 2:39\n\n\nBut those of us living\nin environmental justice communities\nare the canary in the coal mine.\nWe feel the problems right now,\nand have for some time.\nEnvironmental justice, for those of you\nwho may not be familiar with the term,\ngoes something like this:\nno community should be saddled\nwith more environmental burdens\nand less environmental benefits\nthan any other.\n\n\n\n 2:58\n\n\nUnfortunately, race and class\nare extremely reliable indicators\nas to where one might find the good stuff,\nlike parks and trees,\nand where one might find the bad stuff,\nlike power plants and waste facilities.\nAs a black person in America,\nI am twice as likely as a white person\nto live in an area where air pollution\nposes the greatest risk to my health.\nI am five times more likely\nto live within walking distance\nof a power plant or chemical facility,\nwhich I do.\nThese land-use decisions\ncreated the hostile conditions\nthat lead to problems like obesity,\ndiabetes and asthma.\nWhy would someone leave their home to go\nfor a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?\nOur 27 percent obesity rate\nis high even for this country,\nand diabetes comes with it.\nOne out of four South Bronx\nchildren has asthma.\nOur asthma hospitalization rate\nis seven times higher\nthan the national average.\nThese impacts are coming everyone's way.\nAnd we all pay dearly\nfor solid waste costs,\nhealth problems associated\nwith pollution and more odiously,\nthe cost of imprisoning\nour young black and Latino men,\nwho possess untold amounts\nof untapped potential.\nFifty percent of our residents\nlive at or below the poverty line;\n25 percent of us are unemployed.\nLow-income citizens often use\nemergency-room visits as primary care.\nThis comes at a high cost to taxpayers\nand produces no proportional benefits.\nPoor people are not only still poor,\nthey are still unhealthy.\n\n\n\n 4:13\n\n\nFortunately, there are many people\nlike me who are striving for solutions\nthat won't compromise the lives\nof low-income communities of color\nin the short term,\nand won't destroy us all in the long term.\nNone of us want that,\nand we all have that in common.\nSo what else do we have in common?\n\n\n\n 4:27\n\n\nWell, first of all,\nwe're all incredibly good-looking.\n\n\n\n 4:30\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:31\n\n\nGraduated high school, college,\npost-graduate degrees,\ntraveled to interesting places,\ndidn't have kids in your early teens,\nfinancially stable, never been imprisoned.\nOK. Good.\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:44\n\n\nBut, besides being a black woman,\nI am different from most of you\nin some other ways.\nI watched nearly half of the buildings\nin my neighborhood burn down.\nMy big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,\nonly to be gunned down\na few blocks from our home.\nJesus.\nI grew up with a crack house\nacross the street.\nYeah, I'm a poor black child\nfrom the ghetto.\nThese things make me different from you.\nBut the things we have in common\nset me apart from most\nof the people in my community,\nand I am in between these two worlds\nwith enough of my heart\nto fight for justice in the other.\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\nSo how did things get so different for us?\nIn the late '40s, my dad —\na Pullman porter, son of a slave —\nbought a house in the Hunts Point\nsection of the South Bronx,\nand a few years later, he married my mom.\nAt the time, the community was a mostly\nwhite, working-class neighborhood.\nMy dad was not alone.\nAnd as others like him pursued\ntheir own version of the American dream,\nwhite flight became common\nin the South Bronx\nand in many cities around the country.\nRed-lining was used by banks,\nwherein certain sections of the city,\nincluding ours, were deemed\noff-limits to any sort of investment.\nMany landlords believed it was more\nprofitable to torch their buildings\nand collect insurance money rather\nthan to sell under those conditions —\ndead or injured former tenants\nnotwithstanding.\n\n\n\n 6:03\n\n\nHunts Point was formerly\na walk-to-work community,\nbut now residents had neither\nwork nor home to walk to.\nA national highway construction boom\nwas added to our problems.\nIn New York State,\nRobert Moses spearheaded\nan aggressive highway-expansion campaign.\nOne of its primary goals was\nto make it easier\nfor residents of wealthy communities\nin Westchester County to go to Manhattan.\nThe South Bronx, which lies in between,\ndid not stand a chance.\nResidents were often given\nless than a month's notice\nbefore their buildings were razed.\n600,000 people were displaced.\nThe common perception was\nthat only pimps and pushers\nand prostitutes were from the South Bronx.\nAnd if you are told\nfrom your earliest days\nthat nothing good is going to come\nfrom your community,\nthat it's bad and ugly,\nhow could it not reflect on you?\nSo now, my family's property\nwas worthless,\nsave for that it was our home,\nand all we had.\nAnd luckily for me, that home\nand the love inside of it,\nalong with help from teachers, mentors\nand friends along the way, was enough.\n\n\n\n 7:04\n\n\nNow, why is this story important?\nBecause from a planning perspective,\neconomic degradation\nbegets environmental degradation,\nwhich begets social degradation.\nThe disinvestment that began\nin the 1960s set the stage\nfor all the environmental\ninjustices that were to come.\nAntiquated zoning and land-use\nregulations are still used to this day\nto continue putting polluting\nfacilities in my neighborhood.\nAre these factors taken into consideration\nwhen land-use policy is decided?\nWhat costs are associated\nwith these decisions?\nAnd who pays? Who profits?\nDoes anything justify\nwhat the local community goes through?\nThis was \"planning\" — in quotes —\nthat did not have\nour best interests in mind.\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nOnce we realized that, we decided\nit was time to do our own planning.\nThat small park I told you about earlier\nwas the first stage of building\na Greenway movement in the South Bronx.\nI wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million\ndollar federal transportation grant\nto design the plan\nfor a waterfront esplanade\nwith dedicated on-street bike paths.\nPhysical improvements help inform\npublic policy regarding traffic safety,\nthe placement of the waste\nand other facilities,\nwhich, if done properly, don't compromise\na community's quality of life.\nThey provide opportunities\nto be more physically active,\nas well as local economic development.\nThink bike shops, juice stands.\nWe secured 20 million dollars\nto build first-phase projects.\nThis is Lafayette Avenue —\nand that's redesigned\nby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.\nAnd once this path is constructed,\nit'll connect the South Bronx\nwith more than 400 acres\nof Randall's Island Park.\nRight now we're separated by about 25 feet\nof water, but this link will change that.\n\n\n\n 8:33\n\n\nAs we nurture the natural environment,\nits abundance will give us back even more.\nWe run a project called the Bronx\n[Environmental] Stewardship Training,\nwhich provides job training in the fields\nof ecological restoration,\nso that folks from our community\nhave the skills to compete\nfor these well-paying jobs.\nLittle by little, we're seeding\nthe area with green-collar jobs —\nand with people that have both\na financial and personal stake\nin their environment.\nThe Sheridan Expressway\nis an underutilized relic\nof the Robert Moses era,\nbuilt with no regard for the neighborhoods\nthat were divided by it.\nEven during rush hour,\nit goes virtually unused.\nThe community created\nan alternative transportation plan\nthat allows for the removal\nof the highway.\nWe have the opportunity now to bring\ntogether all the stakeholders\nto re-envision how this 28 acres\ncan be better utilized\nfor parkland, affordable housing\nand local economic development.\n\n\n\n 9:20\n\n\nWe also built New York City's first green\nand cool roof demonstration project\non top of our offices.\nCool roofs are highly-reflective\nsurfaces that don't absorb solar heat,\nand pass it on to\nthe building or atmosphere.\nGreen roofs are soil and living plants.\nBoth can be used instead\nof petroleum-based roofing materials\nthat absorb heat, contribute\nto urban \"heat island\" effect\nand degrade under the sun,\nwhich we in turn breathe.\nGreen roofs also retain\nup to 75 percent of rainfall,\nso they reduce a city's need to fund\ncostly end-of-pipe solutions —\nwhich, incidentally, are often located\nin environmental justice\ncommunities like mine.\nAnd they provide habitats\nfor our little friends!\n\n\n\n 9:57\n\n\n[Butterfly]\n\n\n\n 9:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:59\n\n\nSo cool!\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nAnyway, the demonstration\nproject is a springboard\nfor our own green roof\ninstallation business,\nbringing jobs and sustainable\neconomic activity to the South Bronx.\n\n\n\n10:08\n\n\n[Green is the new black ...]\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\nI like that, too.\n\n\n\n10:16\n\n\nAnyway, I know Chris told us\nnot to do pitches up here,\nbut since I have all of your attention:\nWe need investors. End of pitch.\nIt's better to ask\nfor forgiveness than permission.\nAnyway —\n\n\n\n10:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:33\n\n\nOK. Katrina.\n\n\n\n10:36\n\n\nPrior to Katrina, the South Bronx\nand New Orleans' Ninth Ward\nhad a lot in common.\nBoth were largely populated\nby poor people of color,\nboth hotbeds of cultural innovation:\nthink hip-hop and jazz.\nBoth are waterfront communities\nthat host both industries and residents\nin close proximity of one another.\nIn the post-Katrina era,\nwe have still more in common.\nWe're at best ignored,\nand maligned and abused, at worst,\nby negligent regulatory agencies,\npernicious zoning\nand lax governmental accountability.\nNeither the destruction of the Ninth Ward\nnor the South Bronx was inevitable.\nBut we have emerged with valuable lessons\nabout how to dig ourselves out.\nWe are more than simply\nnational symbols of urban blight\nor problems to be solved\nby empty campaign promises\nof presidents come and gone.\nNow will we let the Gulf Coast\nlanguish for a decade or two,\nlike the South Bronx did?\nOr will we take proactive steps\nand learn from the homegrown resource\nof grassroots activists\nthat have been born of desperation\nin communities like mine?\n\n\n\n11:33\n\n\nNow listen, I do not expect individuals,\ncorporations or government\nto make the world a better place\nbecause it is right or moral.\nThis presentation today only represents\nsome of what I've been through.\nLike a tiny little bit. You've no clue.\nBut I'll tell you later,\nif you want to know.\n\n\n\n11:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:51\n\n\nBut — I know it's the bottom line,\nor one's perception of it,\nthat motivates people in the end.\nI'm interested in what I like to call\nthe \"triple bottom line\"\nthat sustainable development can produce.\nDevelopments that have the potential\nto create positive returns\nfor all concerned:\nthe developers, government\nand the community\nwhere these projects go up.\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\nAt present, that's not happening\nin New York City.\nAnd we are operating with a comprehensive\nurban-planning deficit.\nA parade of government subsidies\nis going to propose big-box and stadium\ndevelopments in the South Bronx,\nbut there is scant coordination\nbetween city agencies\non how to deal with the cumulative effects\nof increased traffic, pollution,\nsolid waste and the impacts on open space.\nAnd their approaches to local economic\nand job development are so lame\nit's not even funny.\nBecause on top of that,\nthe world's richest sports team\nis replacing the House That Ruth Built\nby destroying two\nwell-loved community parks.\nNow, we'll have even less\nthan that stat I told you about earlier.\nAnd although less than 25 percent\nof South Bronx residents own cars,\nthese projects include\nthousands of new parking spaces,\nyet zip in terms of mass public transit.\nNow, what's missing from the larger debate\nis a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis\nbetween not fixing an unhealthy,\nenvironmentally-challenged community,\nversus incorporating structural,\nsustainable changes.\nMy agency is working closely\nwith Columbia University and others\nto shine a light on these issues.\n\n\n\n13:18\n\n\nNow let's get this straight:\nI am not anti-development.\nOurs is a city, not a wilderness preserve.\nAnd I've embraced my inner capitalist.\nAnd, but I don't have —\n\n\n\n13:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:30\n\n\nYou probably all have,\nand if you haven't, you need to.\n\n\n\n13:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:37\n\n\nSo I don't have a problem\nwith developers making money.\nThere's enough precedent out there\nto show that a sustainable,\ncommunity-friendly development\ncan still make a fortune.\nFellow TEDsters Bill McDonough\nand Amory Lovins —\nboth heroes of mine by the way —\nhave shown that you can actually do that.\nI do have a problem\nwith developments that hyper-exploit\npolitically vulnerable\ncommunities for profit.\nThat it continues is a shame upon us all,\nbecause we are all responsible\nfor the future that we create.\nBut one of the things I do\nto remind myself of greater possibilities,\nis to learn from visionaries\nin other cities.\nThis is my version of globalization.\n\n\n\n14:13\n\n\nLet's take Bogota.\nPoor, Latino, surrounded by\nrunaway gun violence and drug trafficking;\na reputation not unlike\nthat of the South Bronx.\nHowever, this city was blessed\nin the late 1990s\nwith a highly-influential\nmayor named Enrique Peñalosa.\nHe looked at the demographics.\nFew Bogotanos own cars,\nyet a huge portion of the city's resources\nwas dedicated to serving them.\nIf you're a mayor, you can\ndo something about that.\nHis administration narrowed key municipal\nthoroughfares from five lanes to three,\noutlawed parking on those streets,\nexpanded pedestrian walkways\nand bike lanes,\ncreated public plazas,\ncreated one of the most efficient\nbus mass-transit systems\nin the entire world.\nFor his brilliant efforts,\nhe was nearly impeached.\nBut as people began to see\nthat they were being put first\non issues reflecting\ntheir day-to-day lives,\nincredible things happened.\nPeople stopped littering.\nCrime rates dropped, because the streets\nwere alive with people.\nHis administration attacked several\ntypical urban problems at one time,\nand on a third-world budget, at that.\nWe have no excuse\nin this country, I'm sorry.\nBut the bottom line is:\ntheir people-first agenda\nwas not meant to penalize\nthose who could actually afford cars,\nbut rather, to provide opportunities\nfor all Bogotanos to participate\nin the city's resurgence.\nThat development should not come\nat the expense of the majority\nof the population\nis still considered\na radical idea here in the U.S.\nBut Bogota's example\nhas the power to change that.\n\n\n\n15:43\n\n\nYou, however, are blessed\nwith the gift of influence.\nThat's why you're here and why you\nvalue the information we exchange.\nUse your influence\nin support of comprehensive,\nsustainable change everywhere.\nDon't just talk about it at TED.\nThis is a nationwide policy agenda\nI'm trying to build,\nand as you all know,\npolitics are personal.\nHelp me make green the new black.\nHelp me make sustainability sexy.\nMake it a part of your dinner\nand cocktail conversations.\nHelp me fight for environmental\nand economic justice.\nSupport investments\nwith a triple-bottom-line return.\nHelp me democratize sustainability\nby bringing everyone to the table,\nand insisting that comprehensive\nplanning can be addressed everywhere.\nOh good, glad I have a little more time!\n\n\n\n16:28\n\n\nListen — when I spoke to Mr. Gore\nthe other day after breakfast,\nI asked him how environmental justice\nactivists were going to be included\nin his new marketing strategy.\nHis response was a grant program.\nI don't think he understood\nthat I wasn't asking for funding.\nI was making him an offer.\n\n\n\n16:53\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:00\n\n\nWhat troubled me was that this\ntop-down approach is still around.\nNow, don't get me wrong, we need money.\n\n\n\n17:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n17:09\n\n\nBut grassroots groups\nare needed at the table\nduring the decision-making process.\nOf the 90 percent of the energy\nthat Mr. Gore reminded us\nthat we waste every day,\ndon't add wasting our energy, intelligence\nand hard-earned experience to that count.\n\n\n\n17:29\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:34\n\n\nI have come from so far\nto meet you like this.\nPlease don't waste me.\nBy working together,\nwe can become one of those small,\nrapidly-growing groups of individuals\nwho actually have the audacity and courage\nto believe that we actually\ncan change the world.\nWe might have come to this conference\nfrom very, very different\nstations in life,\nbut believe me, we all share\none incredibly powerful thing.\nWe have nothing to lose\nand everything to gain.\n\n\n\n18:14\n\n\nCiao, bellos!\n\n\n\n18:15\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nTiq Milan: Our first conversation\nwas on Facebook,\nand it was three days long.\n\n\n\n 0:16\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:18\n\n\nWe shared over 3,000 messages between us,\nand it was during those 72 hours\nthat I knew she was going to be my wife.\nWe didn't wait any prerequisite\namount of time for our courtship;\nwe told each other\nthe vulnerable truths up front:\nI am a transgender man,\nwhich means the F on my birth\ncertificate should have stood for \"False,\"\ninstead of \"Female.\"\n\n\n\n 0:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\nWalking around as a woman in the world\nfelt like walking with\npebbles in my shoes.\nIt took the rhythm out of my swagger,\nit threw me off balance,\nit pained me with every step\nI took forward.\nBut today I'm a man of my own intention;\na man of my own design.\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\nKim Katrin Milan: I am\na cisgender queer woman.\nCisgender means the gender\nI was assigned at birth\nis still and has always been female.\nThis doesn't make me natural or normal,\nthis is just one way of describing\nthe many different ways\nthat we exist in this world.\nAnd queer is a cultural term,\nbut in this case,\nit refers to the way that I'm not\nrestricted by gender\nwhen it comes to choosing partners.\nI've identified in a few different ways —\nas a bisexual, as a lesbian —\nbut for me,\nqueerness encompasses all of the layers\nof who I am and how I've loved.\nI'm layers, and not fractions.\nAnd for me,\nthe fact that he was queer\nmeant that I could trust his courtship\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n\n\n 1:35\n\n\nAs queer and trans people,\nwe're so often excluded\nfrom institutions and traditions.\nWe create spaces outside of convention,\nincluding the conventions of time.\nAnd in those 3,000 messages between us,\nwe collapsed time;\nwe queered it;\nwe laid it all on the table.\n\n\n\n 1:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:54\n\n\nWith no pretense at all.\nAnd this meant that we were able\nto commit to each other\nin a profoundly different way.\n\n\n\n 2:01\n\n\nSo often what we're told is this idea\nof the \"Golden Rule,\"\nthat we should treat other people\nthe way we want to be treated.\nBut the problem with that\nis that it assumes that we are\nthe standard for other people,\nand we're not.\nWe need to treat other people\nthe way they want to be treated,\nwhich means we had to ask.\nI couldn't assume that the kind\nof love that Tiq needed\nwas the same kind of love that I needed.\nSo I asked him everything —\nabout his fears, his insecurities —\nand we started from there.\n\n\n\n 2:30\n\n\nTM: I didn't know what\nkind of love I needed.\nI had just come out of a year-long fog\nof being rejected and utterly depleted.\nI had someone look me in my eyes\nand tell me that I was unworthy\nof their love because I was trans.\nAnd there's a culture of lovelessness\nthat we've created around\ntransgender people.\nIt's reasoned, justified\nand often signed into law.\nAnd I was a heartbeat away\nfrom internalizing that message,\nthat I wasn't worthy.\nBut Kim said that I was her ideal —\nthe heartbroken mess that I was.\n\n\n\n 2:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:00\n\n\nKKM: He totally was my ideal.\n\n\n\n 3:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:03\n\n\nIn more ways than one.\nBoth poets, writers, creatives\nwith a long history\nof community work behind us,\nand big, huge dreams\nof a family in front of us,\nwe shared a lot of things in common,\nbut we were also incredibly different.\nI've been a lifelong traveler\nand a bit of an orphan,\nwhereas he comes from a huge family,\nand definitely stays grounded.\nI often kind of sum up\nthe differences in our strengths\nby saying, \"Keep me safe,\nand I'll keep you wild.\"\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:33\n\n\nTM: We have marginalized identities\nbut we don't live marginalized lives.\nBeing queer and trans is about creating\nnew ways of existing.\nIt's about loving people as they are,\nnot as they're supposed to be.\nKim is unapologetically feminine\nin a world that is often cruel and violent\nto women who are\ntoo proud and too freeing.\nAnd I didn't enter into this union\nunder the auspices that she\nwas going to be my helper or my rib,\nbut a fully complex —\n\n\n\n 3:59\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:00\n\n\nKKM: Right? That's not right.\n\n\n\n 4:03\n\n\nTM: But a fully complex human being\nwhose femininity wasn't for me\nto rein in, control or critique.\nIt's her brilliance,\nthe way she leads with compassion,\nand how she never loses\nsight of her empathy.\nShe has been my hero since day one.\n\n\n\n 4:17\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 4:20\n\n\nKKM: Our relationship has always been\nabout setting each other free.\nOne of the first questions I asked him\nwas what dreams he had left to accomplish,\nand how would I help him get there.\nHis dreams to live as a poet,\nto adopt and raise a family together,\nto live a life that he was proud of,\nand one that would live up to\nhis mother's incredible legacy.\nAnd I really appreciated that we\nwere able to start from that place,\nand not from a place\nthat was around figuring out\nhow to make each other work together.\nAnd I think this really allowed us\nto grow into the people that we were\nin a way that was incredibly different.\nI love him whole;\npre-transition, now and in the future.\nAnd it's this love that had us\ncommitted to each other\nbefore we'd even seen each other's faces.\n\n\n\n 5:05\n\n\nTM: My mother's biggest\nconcern when I transitioned\nwas who was going to love me as I am.\nHad being transgender somehow\nprecluded me from love and monogamy\nbecause I was supposedly\nborn in the wrong body?\nBut it's this type of structuring\nthat has to be reframed\nin order to let love in.\nMy body never betrayed me,\nand my body was never wrong.\nIt's this restrictive,\nbinary thinking on gender\nthat said that I didn't exist.\nBut when we met,\nshe loved me for exactly how I showed up.\nShe would trace her fingers\nalong the numb keloid scars\nleft by my top surgery.\nScars that run from the middle of my chest\nall the way out to my outer torso.\nShe said that these were\nreminders of my strength\nand everything that I went through\nand nothing for me to be ashamed of.\nSo sprinting towards her hand in marriage\nwas the queerest thing that I could do.\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:58\n\n\nIt flew in the face of more\nconventional trajectories\nof love and relationships,\nbecause God was never supposed\nto bless a union for folks like us,\nand the law was never\nsupposed to recognize it.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nKKM: So on May 5, 2014,\njust about three months\nafter meeting online,\nwe were married on the steps\nof City Hall in Manhattan,\nand it was beautiful\nin every conceivable way.\nIt's safe to say that we\nreimagined some traditions,\nbut we also kept some old ones\nthat we worked in,\nand we created something\nthat worked for us.\nMy bouquet and corsage was actually filled\nwith wildflowers from Brooklyn —\nalso added in a little bit of lavender\nand sage to keep us grounded\nbecause we were so nervous.\nAnd it was put together by a sweet\nsister healer friend of ours.\nI never wanted a diamond ring,\nbecause conflict and convention\nare not my thing,\nso my ring is the deepest purple,\nlike the color of my crown chakra,\nand set in place with my birthstones.\n\n\n\n 6:58\n\n\nThe gift of queerness is options.\nI never had to choose his last name,\nit was never an exception,\nbut I did because I am\nmy father's bastard child,\nsomeone who has always been\nan apology, a secret, an imposition.\nAnd it was incredibly freeing\nto choose the name of a man\nwho chose me first.\n\n\n\n 7:16\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 7:23\n\n\nTM: So we told some family\nand some close friends,\nmany of whom were still in disbelief\nas we took our vows.\nFittingly, we posted all of our wedding\nphotos on Facebook,\nwhere we met —\nand Instagram, of course.\nAnd we quickly realized\nthat our coming together was more\nthan just a union of two people,\nbut was a model of possibility\nfor the millions of LGBTQ folks\nwho have been sold this lie\nthat family and matrimony\nis antithetical to who they are —\nfor those of us\nwho rarely get to see ourselves\nreflected in love and happiness.\n\n\n\n 7:55\n\n\nKKM: And the thing is,\nabsolutely we are marginalized\nbecause of our identities,\nbut it also emboldens us\nto be the people that we are.\nQueerness is our major key;\nblackness is our magic.\nIt's because of these things\nthat we are able to be hopeful, open,\nreceptive and shape-shifting.\nThese are the things that give us,\nand are such an incredible\nsource of, our strength.\nOur queerness is a source\nof that strength.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nI think of the words of Ottawa-based\npoet Brandon Wint:\n\"Not queer like gay;\nqueer like escaping definition.\nQueer like some sort of fluidity\nand limitlessness all at once.\nQueer like a freedom\ntoo strange to be conquered.\nQueer like the fearlessness\nto imagine what love can look like,\nand to pursue it.\"\n\n\n\n 8:41\n\n\nTM: We are part of a community of folks —\nYeah, that's good right?\n\n\n\n 8:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:47\n\n\nWe are part of a community of folks\nwho are living their authentic selves\nall along the gender spectrum,\ndespite the ubiquitous threat of violence,\ndespite the undercurrent of anxiety\nthat always is present\nfor people who live on their own terms.\nGlobally, a transgender person\nis murdered every 21 hours.\nAnd the United States has had more\ntrans murders on record this year\nthan any year to date.\nHowever, our stories are much more\nthan this rigid dichotomy\nof strength and resilience.\nWe are expanding the human\ncomplexity on these margins,\nand we are creating freedom\non these margins.\n\n\n\n 9:27\n\n\nKKM: And we don't have any blueprints.\nWe're creating a world\nthat we have literally never seen before;\norganizing families based\non love and not by blood,\nguiding by a compassion that so few of us\nhave been shown ourselves.\n\n\n\n 9:41\n\n\nSo many of us have not received\nlove from our families —\nhave been betrayed by the people\nthat we trust most.\nSo what we do here is we create\nentirely new languages of love.\nOnes that are about creating the space\nfor us to be our authentic selves\nand not imposing this standard\nof what masculinity or femininity\nis supposed to be.\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\nTM: We are interested\nin love and inclusion\nas a tool of revolutionary change, right?\nAnd the idea is simply,\nif we drop all our preconceived notions\nabout how somebody is supposed to be —\nin their body, in their\ngender, in their skin —\nif we take the intentional steps\nto unlearn these deep-seated biases\nand create space for people\nto be self-determined,\nand embrace who they are,\nthen we will definitely create a better\nworld than the one we were born into.\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:36\n\n\nKKM: We want to mark this time in history\nby leaving evidence of the fact\nthat we were here.\nWe open up little windows\ninto our relationship\nfor our community to bear witness,\nand we do this because we want\nto make maps to the future\nand not monuments to ourselves.\nOur experience does not invalidate\nother peoples' experience,\nbut it should and necessarily does\ncomplicate this idea\nof what love and marriage\nare supposed to be.\n\n\n\n11:03\n\n\nTM: OK, now for all the talking,\nand inspiring,\nand possibility-modeling we've done,\nwe've been nowhere near perfect.\nAnd we've had to hold\na mirror up to ourselves.\nAnd I saw that I wasn't\nalways the best listener,\nand that my ego got in the way\nof our progress as a couple.\nAnd I've had to really assess\nthese deep-seated, sexist ideas\nthat I've had about the value\nof a woman's experience in the world.\nI've had to reevaluate what it means\nto be in allyship with my wife.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\n\nKKM: And I had to remind myself\nof a lot of things, too.\nWhat it means to be hard on the issues,\nbut soft on the person.\nWhile we were writing this,\nwe got into a massive fight.\n\n\n\n11:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:44\n\n\nFor so many different reasons,\nbut based on the content about our values\nand our lived experiences —\nand we were really hurt, you know?\nBecause what we do and how we love\nputs ourselves entirely on the line.\nBut even though the fight lasted\nover the course of two days —\n\n\n\n12:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:03\n\n\nWe were able to come back\ntogether to each other,\nand recommit to ourselves,\nto each other and to our marriage.\nAnd that really yielded\nsome of the most passionate parts\nof what we share with you here today.\n\n\n\n12:15\n\n\nTM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,\nwhich I think doesn't happen enough.\nI've had to interrogate masculinity;\nthe toxic privileges that come\nwith being a man don't define me,\nbut I have to be accountable\nfor how it shows up in my life every day.\nI have allowed my wife\nto do all of the emotional labor\nof prying open the lines of communication\nwhen I'd rather clam up and run away.\n\n\n\n12:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:38\n\n\nI've stripped away emotional support\ninstead of facing my own vulnerabilities,\nparticularly around the heartbreaking\nmiscarriage we suffered last year,\nand I'm sorry for that.\nSometimes as men,\nwe get to take the easy way out.\nAnd so my journey as a trans person\nis about reimagining masculinity.\nAbout creating a manhood\nthat isn't measured\nby the power it wields,\nby the entitlements afforded to it,\nor any simulacrum of control\nthat it can muster,\nbut works in tandem with femininity,\nand is guided by my spirit.\n\n\n\n13:09\n\n\nKKM: Y'all ...\n\n\n\n13:11\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nAnd this has created the space\nfor my femininity to flourish\nin a way I had never experienced before.\nHe never is threatened by my sexuality,\nhe never polices what I wear or how I act.\nI cook but he does way more\nof the cleaning than I do.\nAnd when we're rushing\nto get out of the house\nand we have so much to handle,\nhe handles everything,\nso I have time to do my hair and makeup.\n\n\n\n13:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:43\n\n\nHe understands that this is my armor,\nand he never treats femininity\nas though it is frivolous or superficial,\nand this, and him —\nhe grows my experience\nof gender every single day.\n\n\n\n13:55\n\n\nTM: I love to watch her\nget dressed in the morning.\nWatching her in the closet,\nlooking for something comfortable\nand colorful, and tight,\nand safe —\n\n\n\n14:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:06\n\n\nBut it's challenging to watch her\nnegotiate her decisions\nlooking for something that's going\nto get the least amount of

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nWhat if I told you that time has a race,\na race in the contemporary way\nthat we understand race\nin the United States?\nTypically, we talk about race\nin terms of black and white issues.\nIn the African-American communities\nfrom which I come,\nwe have a long-standing\nmulti-generational joke\nabout what we call \"CP time,\"\nor \"colored people's time.\"\nNow, we no longer refer\nto African-Americans as \"colored,\"\nbut this long-standing joke\nabout our perpetual lateness to church,\nto cookouts, to family events\nand even to our own funerals, remains.\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nI personally am a stickler for time.\nIt's almost as if my mother,\nwhen I was growing up, said,\n\"We will not be those black people.\"\nSo we typically arrive to events\n30 minutes early.\n\n\n\n 1:01\n\n\nBut today, I want to talk to you\nmore about the political nature of time,\nfor if time had a race,\nit would be white.\nWhite people own time.\n\n\n\n 1:13\n\n\nI know, I know.\nMaking such \"incendiary statements\"\nmakes us uncomfortable:\nHaven't we moved past the point\nwhere race really matters?\nIsn't race a heavy-handed concept?\nShouldn't we go ahead\nwith our enlightened, progressive selves\nand relegate useless concepts like race\nto the dustbins of history?\nHow will we ever get over racism\nif we keep on talking about race?\nPerhaps we should lock up our concepts\nof race in a time capsule,\nbury them and dig them up\nin a thousand years,\npeer at them with the clearly\nmore enlightened,\nraceless versions of ourselves\nthat belong to the future.\nBut you see there,\nthat desire to mitigate the impact\nof race and racism shows up\nin how we attempt to manage time,\nin the ways we narrate history,\nin the ways we attempt to shove\nthe negative truths of the present\ninto the past,\nin the ways we attempt to argue\nthat the future that we hope for\nis the present in which\nwe're currently living.\n\n\n\n 2:14\n\n\nNow, when Barack Obama\nbecame President of the US in 2008,\nmany Americans declared\nthat we were post-racial.\nI'm from the academy\nwhere we're enamored\nwith being post-everything.\nWe're postmodern, we're post-structural,\nwe're post-feminist.\n\"Post\" has become\na simple academic appendage\nthat we apply to a range of terms\nto mark the way we were.\nBut prefixes alone don't have the power\nto make race and racism\na thing of the past.\nThe US was never \"pre-race.\"\nSo to claim that we're post-race when we\nhave yet to grapple with the impact\nof race on black people,\nLatinos or the indigenous\nis disingenuous.\nJust about the moment\nwe were preparing to celebrate\nour post-racial future,\nour political conditions became\nthe most racial they've been\nin the last 50 years.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\nSo today, I want to offer to you\nthree observations,\nabout the past, the present\nand the future of time,\nas it relates to the combating\nof racism and white dominance.\n\n\n\n 3:15\n\n\nFirst: the past.\nTime has a history,\nand so do black people.\nBut we treat time as though\nit is timeless,\nas though it has always been this way,\nas though it doesn't have\na political history\nbound up with the plunder\nof indigenous lands,\nthe genocide of indigenous people\nand the stealing of Africans\nfrom their homeland.\nWhen white male European philosophers\nfirst thought to conceptualize\ntime and history, one famously declared,\n\"[Africa] is no historical\npart of the World.\"\nHe was essentially saying\nthat Africans were people\noutside of history\nwho had had no impact on time\nor the march of progress.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nThis idea, that black people\nhave had no impact on history,\nis one of the foundational ideas\nof white supremacy.\nIt's the reason that Carter G. Woodson\ncreated \"Negro History Week\" in 1926.\nIt's the reason that we continue\nto celebrate Black History Month\nin the US every February.\n\n\n\n 4:17\n\n\nNow, we also see this idea\nthat black people are people either\nalternately outside of the bounds of time\nor stuck in the past,\nin a scenario where,\nmuch as I'm doing right now,\na black person stands up and insists\nthat racism still matters,\nand a person, usually white,\nsays to them,\n\"Why are you stuck in the past?\nWhy can't you move on?\nWe have a black president.\nWe're past all that.\"\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\nWilliam Faulkner famously said,\n\"The past is never dead.\nIt's not even past.\"\nBut my good friend\nProfessor Kristie Dotson says,\n\"Our memory is longer than our lifespan.\"\nWe carry, all of us,\nfamily and communal\nhopes and dreams with us.\nWe don't have the luxury\nof letting go of the past.\nBut sometimes,\nour political conditions are so troubling\nthat we don't know\nif we're living in the past\nor we're living in the present.\nTake, for instance,\nwhen Black Lives Matter protesters\ngo out to protest unjust killings\nof black citizens by police,\nand the pictures that emerge\nfrom the protest\nlook like they could have been\ntaken 50 years ago.\nThe past won't let us go.\nBut still, let us press our way\ninto the present.\n\n\n\n 5:42\n\n\nAt present, I would argue\nthat the racial struggles\nwe are experiencing\nare clashes over time and space.\nWhat do I mean?\nWell, I've already told you\nthat white people own time.\nThose in power dictate\nthe pace of the workday.\nThey dictate how much money\nour time is actually worth.\nAnd Professor George Lipsitz argues\nthat white people even dictate\nthe pace of social inclusion.\nThey dictate how long\nit will actually take\nfor minority groups to receive the rights\nthat they have been fighting for.\n\n\n\n 6:18\n\n\nLet me loop back to the past quickly\nto give you an example.\nIf you think about\nthe Civil Rights Movement\nand the cries of its leaders\nfor \"Freedom Now,\"\nthey were challenging the slow pace\nof white social inclusion.\nBy 1965, the year\nthe Voting Rights Act was passed,\nthere had been a full 100 years\nbetween the end of the Civil War\nand the conferral of voting rights\non African-American communities.\nDespite the urgency of a war,\nit still took a full 100 years\nfor actual social inclusion to occur.\n\n\n\n 6:49\n\n\nSince 2012,\nconservative state legislatures\nacross the US have ramped up attempts\nto roll back African-American\nvoting rights\nby passing restrictive voter ID laws\nand curtailing early voting opportunities.\nThis past July, a federal court\nstruck down North Carolina's voter ID law\nsaying it \"... targeted African-Americans\nwith surgical precision.\"\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nRestricting African-American inclusion\nin the body politic\nis a primary way that we attempt\nto manage and control people\nby managing and controlling time.\nBut another place that we see\nthese time-space clashes\nis in gentrifying cities\nlike Atlanta, Brooklyn,\nPhiladelphia, New Orleans\nand Washington, DC —\nplaces that have had\nblack populations for generations.\nBut now, in the name\nof urban renewal and progress,\nthese communities are pushed out,\nin service of bringing them\ninto the 21st century.\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nProfessor Sharon Holland asked:\nWhat happens when a person\nwho exists in time\nmeets someone who only occupies space?\nThese racial struggles\nare battles over those\nwho are perceived to be space-takers\nand those who are perceived\nto be world-makers.\nThose who control the flow\nand thrust of history\nare considered world-makers\nwho own and master time.\nIn other words: white people.\nBut when Hegel famously said that Africa\nwas no historical part of the world,\nhe implied that it was merely\na voluminous land mass\ntaking up space\nat the bottom of the globe.\nAfricans were space-takers.\nSo today, white people continue to control\nthe flow and thrust of history,\nwhile too often treating black people\nas though we are merely taking up space\nto which we are not entitled.\nTime and the march of progress\nis used to justify\na stunning degree of violence\ntowards our most vulnerable populations,\nwho, being perceived as space-takers\nrather than world-makers,\nare moved out of the places\nwhere they live,\nin service of bringing them\ninto the 21st century.\n\n\n\n 9:02\n\n\nShortened life span according to zip code\nis just one example of the ways\nthat time and space cohere\nin an unjust manner\nin the lives of black people.\nChildren who are born\nin New Orleans zip code 70124,\nwhich is 93 percent white,\ncan expect to live a full 25 years longer\nthan children born\nin New Orleans zip code 70112,\nwhich is 60 percent black.\nChildren born in Washington, DC's\nwealthy Maryland suburbs\ncan expect to live a full 20 years longer\nthan children born\nin its downtown neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates argues\nthat, \"The defining feature\nof being drafted into the Black race\nis the inescapable robbery of time.\"\nWe experience time discrimination,\nhe tells us,\nnot just as structural,\nbut as personal:\nin lost moments of joy,\nlost moments of connection,\nlost quality of time with loved ones\nand lost years of healthy quality of life.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nIn the future, do you see black people?\nDo black people have a future?\nWhat if you belong\nto the very race of people\nwho have always been pitted against time?\nWhat if your group is the group\nfor whom a future was never imagined?\nThese time-space clashes —\nbetween protesters and police,\nbetween gentrifiers and residents —\ndon't paint a very pretty picture\nof what America hopes\nfor black people's future.\nIf the present is any indicator,\nour children will be under-educated,\nhealth maladies will take their toll\nand housing will continue\nto be unaffordable.\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\nSo if we're really ready\nto talk about the future,\nperhaps we should begin\nby admitting that we're out of time.\nWe black people\nhave always been out of time.\nTime does not belong to us.\nOur lives are lives of perpetual urgency.\nTime is used to displace us,\nor conversely, we are urged\ninto complacency\nthrough endless calls to just be patient.\nBut if past is prologue,\nlet us seize upon the ways in which\nwe're always out of time anyway\nto demand with urgency\nfreedom now.\n\n\n\n11:28\n\n\nI believe the future is what we make it.\nBut first, we have to decide\nthat time belongs to all of us.\nNo, we don't all get equal time,\nbut we can decide that the time\nwe do get is just and free.\nWe can stop making your zip code\nthe primary determinant\nof your lifespan.\nWe can stop stealing learning time\nfrom black children\nthrough excessive use\nof suspensions and expulsions.\nWe can stop stealing time\nfrom black people\nthrough long periods\nof incarceration for nonviolent crimes.\nThe police can stop\nstealing time and black lives\nthrough use of excessive force.\n\n\n\n12:06\n\n\nI believe the future is what we make it.\nBut we can't get there\non colored people's time\nor white time\nor your time\nor even my time.\nIt's our time.\nOurs.\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:24\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nSo I would like to start by telling you\nabout one of my greatest friends,\nOkoloma Maduewesi.\nOkoloma lived on my street\nand looked after me like a big brother.\nIf I liked a boy,\nI would ask Okoloma's opinion.\nOkoloma died in the notorious\nSosoliso plane crash\nin Nigeria in December of 2005.\nAlmost exactly seven years ago.\nOkoloma was a person I could argue with,\nlaugh with and truly talk to.\nHe was also the first person\nto call me a feminist.\n\n\n\n 0:46\n\n\nI was about fourteen,\nwe were at his house, arguing.\nBoth of us bristling\nwith half bit knowledge\nfrom books that we had read.\nI don't remember what this\nparticular argument was about,\nbut I remember\nthat as I argued and argued,\nOkoloma looked at me and said,\n\"You know, you're a feminist.\"\nIt was not a compliment.\n\n\n\n 1:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nI could tell from his tone,\nthe same tone that you would use\nto say something like,\n\"You're a supporter of terrorism.\"\n\n\n\n 1:13\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:16\n\n\nI did not know exactly\nwhat this word \"feminist\" meant,\nand I did not want Okoloma\nto know that I did not know.\nSo I brushed it aside,\nand I continued to argue.\nAnd the first thing\nI planned to do when I got home\nwas to look up the word\n\"feminist\" in the dictionary.\n\n\n\n 1:31\n\n\nNow fast forward to some years later,\nI wrote a novel about a man\nwho among other things beats his wife\nand whose story doesn't end very well.\nWhile I was promoting\nthe novel in Nigeria,\na journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,\ntold me he wanted to advise me.\nAnd for the Nigerians here,\nI'm sure we're all familiar\nwith how quick our people are\nto give unsolicited advice.\nHe told me that people were saying\nthat my novel was feminist\nand his advice to me —\nand he was shaking his head\nsadly as he spoke —\nwas that I should never\ncall myself a feminist\nbecause feminists\nare women who are unhappy\nbecause they cannot find husbands.\n\n\n\n 2:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:20\n\n\nSo I decided to call myself\n\"a happy feminist.\"\nThen an academic, a Nigerian woman told me\nthat feminism was not our culture\nand that feminism wasn't African,\nand that I was calling myself a feminist\nbecause I had been corrupted\nby \"Western books.\"\nWhich amused me,\nbecause a lot of my early readings\nwere decidedly unfeminist.\nI think I must have read every single\nMills & Boon romance published\nbefore I was sixteen.\nAnd each time I tried to read those books\ncalled \"the feminist classics,\"\nI'd get bored, and I really\nstruggled to finish them.\nBut anyway, since feminism was un-African,\nI decided that I would now call myself\n\"a happy African feminist.\"\nAt some point I was a happy African\nfeminist who does not hate men\nand who likes lip gloss\nand who wears high heels\nfor herself but not for men.\n\n\n\n 3:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\nOf course a lot of this\nwas tongue-in-cheek,\nbut that word feminist is so heavy\nwith baggage, negative baggage.\nYou hate men, you hate bras,\nyou hate African culture,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n\n\n 3:21\n\n\nNow here's a story from my childhood.\nWhen I was in primary school,\nmy teacher said at the beginning of term\nthat she would give the class a test\nand whoever got the highest score\nwould be the class monitor.\nNow, class monitor was a big deal.\nIf you were a class monitor,\nyou got to write down\nthe names of noisemakers —\n\n\n\n 3:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:42\n\n\nwhich was having enough power of its own.\nBut my teacher would also give you\na cane to hold in your hand\nwhile you walk around\nand patrol the class for noisemakers.\nNow, of course you were not\nactually allowed to use the cane.\nBut it was an exciting prospect\nfor the nine-year-old me.\nI very much wanted\nto be the class monitor.\nAnd I got the highest score on the test.\nThen, to my surprise, my teacher said\nthat the monitor had to be a boy.\nShe had forgotten\nto make that clear earlier\nbecause she assumed it was ... obvious.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:17\n\n\nA boy had the second highest\nscore on the test,\nand he would be monitor.\nNow, what was even more\ninteresting about this\nis that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul\nwho had no interest\nin patrolling the class with the cane,\nwhile I was full of ambition to do so.\nBut I was female and he was male,\nand so he became the class monitor.\nAnd I've never forgotten that incident.\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\nI often make the mistake of thinking\nthat something that is obvious to me\nis just as obvious to everyone else.\nNow, take my dear friend Louis\nfor example.\nLouis is a brilliant, progressive man,\nand we would have conversations\nand he would tell me,\n\"I don't know what you mean by things\nbeing different or harder for women.\nMaybe in the past, but not now.\"\nAnd I didn't understand how Louis\ncould not see what seems so self-evident.\nThen one evening, in Lagos,\nLouis and I went out with friends.\nAnd for people here\nwho are not familiar with Lagos,\nthere's that wonderful Lagos' fixture,\nthe sprinkling of energetic men\nwho hang around outside establishments\nand very dramatically\n\"help\" you park your car.\nI was impressed\nwith the particular theatrics\nof the man who found us\na parking spot that evening.\nAnd so as we were leaving,\nI decided to leave him a tip.\nI opened my bag,\nput my hand inside my bag,\nbrought out my money\nthat I had earned from doing my work,\nand I gave it to the man.\nAnd he, this man who was\nvery grateful and very happy,\ntook the money from me,\nlooked across at Louis\nand said, \"Thank you, sir!\"\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:02\n\n\nLouis looked at me, surprised,\nand asked, \"Why is he thanking me?\nI didn't give him the money.\"\nThen I saw realization\ndawn on Louis' face.\nThe man believed that whatever money I had\nhad ultimately come from Louis.\nBecause Louis is a man.\n\n\n\n 6:23\n\n\nMen and women are different.\nWe have different hormones,\nwe have different sexual organs,\nwe have different biological abilities.\nWomen can have babies, men can't.\nAt least not yet.\n\n\n\n 6:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:36\n\n\nMen have testosterone and are\nin general physically stronger than women.\nThere's slightly more women\nthan men in the world,\nabout 52 percent of the world's\npopulation is female.\nBut most of the positions of power\nand prestige are occupied by men.\nThe late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate,\nWangari Maathai,\nput it simply and well when she said:\n\"The higher you go,\nthe fewer women there are.\"\nIn the recent US elections we kept hearing\nof the Lilly Ledbetter law,\nand if we go beyond the nicely\nalliterative name of that law,\nit was really about a man and a woman\ndoing the same job,\nbeing equally qualified,\nand the man being paid more\nbecause he's a man.\n\n\n\n 7:19\n\n\nSo in the literal way, men rule the world,\nand this made sense a thousand years ago\nbecause human beings lived then in a world\nin which physical strength was\nthe most important attribute for survival.\nThe physically stronger person\nwas more likely to lead,\nand men, in general,\nare physically stronger.\nOf course there are many exceptions.\n\n\n\n 7:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nBut today we live\nin a vastly different world.\nThe person more likely to lead\nis not the physically stronger person;\nit is the more creative person,\nthe more intelligent person,\nthe more innovative person,\nand there are no hormones\nfor those attributes.\nA man is as likely as a woman\nto be intelligent,\nto be creative, to be innovative.\nWe have evolved;\nbut it seems to me that our ideas\nof gender had not evolved.\n\n\n\n 8:12\n\n\nSome weeks ago, I walked into a lobby\nof one of the best Nigerian hotels.\nI thought about naming the hotel,\nbut I thought I probably shouldn't.\nAnd a guard at the entrance stopped me\nand asked me annoying questions,\nbecause their automatic assumption is\nthat a Nigerian female walking\ninto a hotel alone is a sex worker.\nAnd by the way,\nwhy do these hotels\nfocus on the ostensible supply\nrather than the demand for sex workers?\nIn Lagos I cannot go alone\ninto many \"reputable\" bars and clubs.\nThey just don't let you in\nif you're a woman alone,\nyou have to be accompanied by a man.\nEach time I walk into\na Nigerian restaurant with a man,\nthe waiter greets the man and ignores me.\nThe waiters are products —\n\n\n\n 8:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:00\n\n\nAt this some women\nfelt like, \"Yes! I thought that!\"\nThe waiters are products of a society\nthat has taught them that men\nare more important than women.\nAnd I know that waiters\ndon't intend any harm.\nBut it's one thing to know intellectually\nand quite another to feel it emotionally.\nEach time they ignore me,\nI feel invisible.\nI feel upset.\nI want to tell them\nthat I am just as human as the man,\nthat I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment.\nThese are little things,\nbut sometimes it's the little things\nthat sting the most.\n\n\n\n 9:32\n\n\nAnd not long ago, I wrote an article\nabout what it means\nto be young and female in Lagos,\nand the printers told me,\n\"It was so angry.\"\nOf course it was angry!\n\n\n\n 9:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:47\n\n\nI am angry.\nGender as it functions today\nis a grave injustice.\nWe should all be angry.\nAnger has a long history\nof bringing about positive change;\nbut, in addition to being angry,\nI'm also hopeful.\nBecause I believe deeply\nin the ability of human beings\nto make and remake\nthemselves for the better.\n\n\n\n10:07\n\n\nGender matters everywhere in the world,\nbut I want to focus on Nigeria\nand on Africa in general,\nbecause it is where I know,\nand because it is where my heart is.\nAnd I would like today to ask\nthat we begin to dream about\nand plan for a different world,\na fairer world,\na world of happier men and happier women\nwho are truer to themselves.\nAnd this is how to start:\nwe must raise our daughters differently.\nWe must also raise our sons differently.\nWe do a great disservice to boys\non how we raise them;\nwe stifle the humanity of boys.\nWe define masculinity\nin a very narrow way,\nmasculinity becomes this hard, small cage\nand we put boys inside the cage.\nWe teach boys to be afraid of fear.\nWe teach boys to be afraid\nof weakness, of vulnerability.\nWe teach them to mask their true selves,\nbecause they have to be,\nin Nigerian speak, \"hard man!\"\nIn secondary school, a boy and a girl,\nboth of them teenagers,\nboth of them with the same amount\nof pocket money, would go out\nand then the boy\nwould be expected always to pay,\nto prove his masculinity.\nAnd yet we wonder why boys are more likely\nto steal money from their parents.\n\n\n\n11:28\n\n\nWhat if both boys and girls were raised\nnot to link masculinity with money?\nWhat if the attitude\nwas not \"the boy has to pay\"\nbut rather \"whoever has more should pay?\"\nNow, of course because\nof that historical advantage,\nit is mostly men who will have more today,\nbut if we start\nraising children differently,\nthen in fifty years, in a hundred years,\nboys will no longer have the pressure\nof having to prove this masculinity.\nBut by far the worst thing we do to males,\nby making them feel\nthat they have to be hard,\nis that we leave them\nwith very fragile egos.\nThe more \"hard man\"\nthe man feels compelled to be,\nthe weaker his ego is.\nAnd then we do a much greater\ndisservice to girls\nbecause we raise them\nto cater to the fragile egos of men.\nWe teach girls to shrink themselves,\nto make themselves smaller,\nwe say to girls,\n\"You can have ambition, but not too much.\"\n\n\n\n12:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:30\n\n\n\"You should aim to be successful,\nbut not too successful,\notherwise you would threaten the man.\"\nIf you are the breadwinner\nin your relationship with a man,\nyou have to pretend that you're not,\nespecially in public,\notherwise you will emasculate him.\n\n\n\n12:45\n\n\nBut what if we question\nthe premise itself?\nWhy should a woman's success\nbe a threat to a man?\nWhat if we decide\nto simply dispose of that word,\nand I don't think there's an English word\nI dislike more than \"emasculation.\"\nA Nigerian acquaintance once asked me\nif I was worried that men\nwould be intimidated by me.\nI was not worried at all.\nIn fact, it had not occurred\nto me to be worried\nbecause a man who would\nbe intimidated by me\nis exactly the kind of man\nI would have no interest in.\n\n\n\n13:16\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:17\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n13:25\n\n\nBut still I was really struck by this.\nBecause I'm female,\nI'm expected to aspire to marriage;\nI'm expected to make my life choices\nalways keeping in mind\nthat marriage is the most important.\nA marriage can be a good thing;\nit can be a source of joy\nand love and mutual support.\nBut why do we teach girls\nto aspire to marriage\nand we don't teach boys the same?\n\n\n\n13:51\n\n\nI know a woman\nwho decided to sell her house\nbecause she didn't want\nto intimidate a man who might marry her.\nI know an unmarried woman in Nigeria\nwho, when she goes to conferences,\nwears a wedding ring\nbecause according to her,\nshe wants the other participants\nin the conference to \"give her respect.\"\nI know young women\nwho are under so much pressure\nfrom family, from friends,\neven from work to get married,\nand they're pushed\nto make terrible choices.\nA woman at a certain age who is unmarried,\nour society teaches her\nto see it as a deep, personal failure.\nAnd a man at a certain age\nwho is unmarried,\nwe just think he hasn't come around\nto making his pick.\n\n\n\n14:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:35\n\n\nIt's easy for us to say,\n\"Oh, but women can\njust say no to all of this.\"\nBut the reality is more difficult\nand more complex.\nWe're all social beings.\nWe internalize ideas\nfrom our socialization.\nEven the language we use\nin talking about marriage\nand relationships illustrates this.\nThe language of marriage\nis often the language of ownership\nrather than the language of partnership.\nWe use the word \"respect\"\nto mean something a woman shows a man\nbut often not something\na man shows a woman.\n\n\n\n15:07\n\n\nBoth men and women in Nigeria will say —\nthis is an expression\nI'm very amused by —\n\"I did it for peace in my marriage.\"\nNow, when men say it,\nit is usually about something\nthat they should not be doing anyway.\n\n\n\n15:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:22\n\n\nSometimes they say it to their friends,\nit's something to say to their friends\nin a kind of fondly exasperated way,\nyou know, something that ultimately\nproves how masculine they are,\nhow needed, how loved.\n\"Oh, my wife said\nI can't go to the club every night,\nso for peace in my marriage,\nI do it only on weekends.\"\n\n\n\n15:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:40\n\n\nNow, when a woman says,\n\"I did it for peace in my marriage,\"\nshe's usually talking\nabout giving up a job,\na dream,\na career.\nWe teach females that in relationships,\ncompromise is what women do.\nWe raise girls to see\neach other as competitors —\nnot for jobs or for accomplishments,\nwhich I think can be a good thing,\nbut for attention of men.\nWe teach girls that they\ncannot be sexual beings\nin the way that boys are.\nIf we have sons, we don't mind\nknowing about our sons' girlfriends.\nBut our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid.\n\n\n\n16:17\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:19\n\n\nBut of course when the time is right,\nwe expect those girls to bring back\nthe perfect man to be their husbands.\nWe police girls,\nwe praise girls for virginity,\nbut we don't praise boys for virginity,\nand it's always made me wonder how exactly\nthis is supposed to work out because ...\n\n\n\n16:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:36\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n16:44\n\n\nI mean, the loss of virginity\nis usually a process that involves ...\n\n\n\n16:49\n\n\nRecently a young woman\nwas gang raped in a university in Nigeria,\nI think some of us know about that.\nAnd the response of many young Nigerians,\nboth male and female,\nwas something along the lines of this:\n\"Yes, rape is wrong.\nBut what is a girl doing\nin a room with four boys?\"\nNow, if we can forget\nthe horrible inhumanity of that response,\nthese Nigerians have been raised\nto think of women as inherently guilty,\nand they have been raised\nto expect so little of men\nthat the idea of men as savage beings\nwithout any control\nis somehow acceptable.\nWe teach girls shame.\n\"Close your legs.\" \"Cover yourself.\"\nWe make them feel\nas though by being born female\nthey're already guilty of something.\nAnd so, girls grow up to be women\nwho cannot see they have desire.\nThey grow up to be women\nwho silence themselves.\nThey grow up to be women\nwho cannot say what they truly think,\nand they grow up —\nand this is the worst thing\nwe did to girls —\nthey grow up to be women\nwho have turned pretense into an art form.\n\n\n\n17:57\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n18:03\n\n\nI know a woman who hates domestic work,\nshe just hates it,\nbut she pretends that she likes it,\nbecause she's been taught\nthat to be \"good wife material\"\nshe has to be —\nto use that Nigerian word —\nvery \"homely.\"\nAnd then she got married,\nand after a while her husband's family\nbegan to complain that she had changed.\n\n\n\n18:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n18:27\n\n\nActually, she had not changed,\nshe just got tired of pretending.\n\n\n\n18:31\n\n\nThe problem with gender,\nis that it prescribes how we should be\nrather than recognizing how we are.\n\n\n\n18:40\n\n\nNow imagine how much happier we would be,\nhow much freer to be\nour true individual selves,\nif we didn't have the weight\nof gender expectations.\nBoys and girls are\nundeniably different biologically,\nbut socialization\nexaggerates the differences\nand then it becomes\na self-fulfilling process.\nNow, take cooking for example.\nToday women in general are more likely\nto do the housework than men,\nthe cooking and cleaning.\nBut why is that?\nIs it because women\nare born with a cooking gene?\n\n\n\n19:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:14\n\n\nOr because over years they have been\nsocialized to see cooking as their role?\nActually, I was going to say that maybe\nwomen are born with a cooking gene,\nuntil I remember that the majority\nof the famous cooks in the world,\nwhom we give the fancy title of \"chefs,\"\nare men.\n\n\n\n19:29\n\n\nI used to look up to my grandmother\nwho was a brilliant, brilliant woman,\nand wonder how she would have been\nif she had the same opportunities\nas men when she was growing up.\n\n\n\n19:39\n\n\nNow today, there are\nmany more opportunities for women\nthan there were\nduring my grandmother's time\nbecause of changes in policy,\nchanges in law,\nall of which are very important.\nBut what matters even more\nis our attitude, our mindset,\nwhat we believe\nand what we value about gender.\nWhat if in raising children\nwe focus on ability instead of gender?\nWhat if in raising children\nwe focus on interest instead of gender?\n\n\n\n20:08\n\n\nI know a family\nwho have a son and a daughter,\nboth of whom are brilliant at school,\nwho are wonderful, lovely children.\nWhen the boy is hungry,\nthe parents say to the girl,\n\"Go and cook Indomie noodles\nfor your brother.\"\n\n\n\n20:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n20:20\n\n\nNow, the daughter doesn't\nparticularly like to cook Indomie noodles,\nbut she's a girl, and so she has to.\nNow, what if the parents,\nfrom the beginning,\ntaught both the boy and the girl\nto cook Indomie?\nCooking, by the way,\nis a very useful skill for boys to have.\nI've never thought it made sense\nto leave such a crucial thing,\nthe ability to nourish oneself —\n\n\n\n20:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n20:46\n\n\nin the hands of others.\n\n\n\n20:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n20:52\n\n\nI know a woman who has the same degree\nand the same job as her husband.\nWhen they get back from work,\nshe does most of the housework,\nwhich I think is true for many marriages.\nBut what struck me about them\nwas that whenever her husband\nchanged the baby's diaper,\nshe said \"thank you\" to him.\nNow, what if she saw this\nas perfectly normal and natural\nthat he should, in fact,\ncare for his child?\n\n\n\n21:17\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n21:20\n\n\nI'm trying to unlearn\nmany of the lessons of gender\nthat I internalized when I was growing up.\nBut I sometimes still feel very vulnerable\nin the face of gender expectations.\nThe first time I taught\na writing class in graduate school,\nI was worried.\nI wasn't worried\nabout the material I would teach\nbecause I was well-prepared,\nand I was going to teach\nwhat I enjoy teaching.\nInstead, I was worried about what to wear.\nI wanted to be taken seriously.\nI knew that because I was female\nI will automatically\nhave to prove my worth.\nAnd I was worried\nthat if I looked too feminine,\nI would not be taken seriously.\nI really wanted to wear\nmy shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt,\nbut I decided not to.\nInstead, I wore a very serious,\nvery manly and very ugly suit.\n\n\n\n22:09\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n22:11\n\n\nBecause the sad truth is\nthat when it comes to appearance\nwe start off with men\nas the standard, as the norm.\nIf a man is getting ready\nfor a business meeting,\nhe doesn't worry\nabout looking too masculine\nand therefore not being taken for granted.\nIf a woman has to get ready\nfor business meeting,\nshe has to worry\nabout looking too feminine\nand what it says and whether or not\nshe will be taken seriously.\n\n\n\n22:35\n\n\nI wish I had not worn\nthat ugly suit that day.\nI've actually banished it\nfrom my closet, by the way.\nHad I then the confidence\nthat I have now to be myself,\nmy students would have benefited\neven more from my teaching,\nbecause I would have been more comfortable\nand more fully and more truly myself.\nI have chosen to no longer\nbe apologetic for my femaleness\nand for my femininity.\n\n\n\n23:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n23:06\n\n\nAnd I want to be respected\nin all of my femaleness\nbecause I deserve to be.\nGender is not an easy\nconversation to have.\nFor both men and women,\nto bring up gender is sometimes\nto encounter almost immediate resistance.\nI can imagine some people here\nare actually thinking,\n\"Women too do sef.\"\nSome of the men here might be thinking,\n\"OK, all of this is interesting,\nbut I don't think like that.\"\nAnd that is part of the problem.\n\n\n\n23:37\n\n\nThat many men do not\nactively think about gender\nor notice gender\nis part of the problem of gender.\nThat many men, say, like my friend Louis,\nthat everything is fine now.\nAnd that many men do nothing to change it.\nIf you are a man and you walk\ninto a restaurant with a woman\nand the waiter greets only you,\ndoes it occur to you to ask the waiter,\n\"Why haven't you greeted her?\"\nBecause gender can be —\n\n\n\n24:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n24:15\n\n\nActually, we may repose\npart of a longer version of this talk.\nSo, because gender can be\na very uncomfortable conversation to have,\nthere are very easy ways to close it,\nto close the conversation.\nSo some people will bring up\nevolutionary biology and apes,\nhow, you know, female apes\nbow down to male apes\nand that sort of thing.\nBut the point is we're not apes.\n\n\n\n24:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n24:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n24:45\n\n\nApes also live on trees\nand have earthworms for breakfast,\nand we don't.\nSome people will say,\n\"Well, poor men also have a hard time.\"\nAnd this is true.\nBut that is not what this —\n\n\n\n25:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n25:01\n\n\nBut this is not\nwhat this conversation is about.\nGender and class\nare different forms of oppression.\nI actually learned quite a bit\nabout systems of oppression\nand how they can be blind to one another\nby talking to black men.\n\n\n\n25:18\n\n\nI was once talking\nto a black man about gender\nand he said to me,\n\"Why do you have to say\n'my experience as a woman'?\nWhy can't it be\n'your experience as a human being'?\"\nNow, this was the same man\nwho would often talk\nabout his experience as a black man.\n\n\n\n25:38\n\n\nGender matters.\nMen and women\nexperience the world differently.\nGender colors the way\nwe experience the world.\nBut we can change that.\n\n\n\n25:47\n\n\nSome people will say,\n\"Oh, but women have the real power,\nbottom power.\"\nAnd for non-Nigerians,\nbottom power is an expression\nwhich I suppose means\nsomething like a woman\nwho uses her sexuality\nto get favors from men.\nBut bottom power is not power at all.\nBottom power means that a woman\nsimply has a good root to tap into,\nfrom time to time —\nsomebody else's power.\nAnd then, of course, we have to wonder\nwhat happens when\nthat somebody else is in a bad mood,\nor sick\nor impotent.\n\n\n\n26:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n26:26\n\n\nSome people will say that a woman\nbeing subordinate to a man is our culture.\nBut culture is constantly changing.\nI have beautiful twin nieces\nwho are fifteen and live in Lagos.\nIf they had been born a hundred years ago\nthey would have been\ntaken away and killed.\nBecause it was our culture,\nit was our culture to kill twins.\n\n\n\n26:50\n\n\nSo what is the point of culture?\nI mean there's the decorative,\nthe dancing ...\nbut also, culture really is about\npreservation and continuity of a people.\nIn my family,\nI am the child who is most interested\nin the story of who we are,\nin our traditions,\nin the knowledge about ancestral lands.\nMy brothers are not as interested as I am.\nBut I cannot participate,\nI cannot go to umunna meetings,\nI cannot have a say.\nBecause I'm female.\nCulture does not make people,\npeople make culture.\nSo if it is in fact true —\n\n\n\n27:25\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n27:29\n\n\nSo if it is in fact true\nthat the full humanity of women\nis not our culture,\nthen we must make it our culture.\n\n\n\n27:37\n\n\nI think very often of my dear friend,\nOkoloma Maduewesi.\nMay he and all the others\nwho passed away in that Sosoliso crash\ncontinue to rest in peace.\nHe will always be remembered\nby those of us who loved him.\nAnd he was right that day many years ago\nwhen he called me a feminist.\n\n\n\n27:58\n\n\nI am a feminist.\nAnd when I looked up the word\nin the dictionary that day,\nthis is what it said:\n\"Feminist: a person\nwho believes in the social, political\nand economic equality of the sexes.\"\nMy great grandmother,\nfrom the stories I've heard,\nwas a feminist.\nShe ran away from the house of the man\nshe did not want to marry\nand ended up marrying\nthe man of her choice.\nShe refused, she protested, she spoke up\nwhenever she felt she was being deprived\nof access, of land, that sort of thing.\n\n\n\n28:30\n\n\nMy great grandmother\ndid not know that word \"feminist,\"\nbut it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.\nMore of us should reclaim that word.\nMy own definition of feminist is:\n\"A feminist is a man or a woman\nwho says —\n\n\n\n28:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n28:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n28:57\n\n\nA feminist is a man or a woman who says,\n\"Yes, there's a problem\nwith gender as it is today,\nand we must fix it.\nWe must do better.\"\nThe best feminist I know\nis my brother Kene.\nHe's also a kind,\ngood-looking, lovely man,\nand he's very masculine.\n\n\n\n29:20\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n29:21\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI once said,\n\"If you want to liberate a society,\nall you need is the Internet.\"\nI was wrong.\n\n\n\n 0:21\n\n\nI said those words back in 2011,\nwhen a Facebook page I anonymously created\nhelped spark the Egyptian revolution.\nThe Arab Spring revealed\nsocial media's greatest potential,\nbut it also exposed\nits greatest shortcomings.\nThe same tool that united us\nto topple dictators\neventually tore us apart.\nI would like to share my own experience\nin using social media for activism,\nand talk about some of the challenges\nI have personally faced\nand what we could do about them.\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\nIn the early 2000s,\nArabs were flooding the web.\nThirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,\nfor connecting with the rest\nof the people around the globe,\nwe escaped our frustrating\npolitical realities\nand lived a virtual, alternative life.\nJust like many of them,\nI was completely apolitical until 2009.\nAt the time, when I logged\ninto social media,\nI started seeing more and more Egyptians\naspiring for political change\nin the country.\nIt felt like I was not alone.\n\n\n\n 1:39\n\n\nIn June 2010,\nInternet changed my life forever.\nWhile browsing Facebook,\nI saw a photo, a terrifying photo,\nof a tortured, dead body\nof a young Egyptian guy.\nHis name was Khaled Said.\nKhaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian\nwho was killed by police.\nI saw myself in his picture.\nI thought, \"I could be Khaled.\"\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\nI could not sleep that night,\nand I decided to do something.\nI anonymously created a Facebook page\nand called it \"We are all Khaled Said.\"\nIn just three days, the page\nhad over 100,000 people,\nfellow Egyptians who shared\nthe same concern.\nWhatever was happening had to stop.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nI recruited my co-admin,\nAbdelRahman Mansour.\nWe worked together for hours and hours.\nWe were crowdsourcing\nideas from the people.\nWe were engaging them.\nWe were calling collectively for actions,\nand sharing news that the regime\ndid not want Egyptians to know.\nThe page became the most followed page\nin the Arab world.\nIt had more fans than established\nmedia organizations\nand even top celebrities.\n\n\n\n 3:05\n\n\nOn January 14, 2011,\nBen Ali fled out of Tunisia\nafter mounting protests\nagainst his regime.\nI saw a spark of hope.\nEgyptians on social media were wondering,\n\"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?\"\nI posted an event\non Facebook and called it\n\"A Revolution against Corruption,\nInjustice and Dictatorship.\"\nI posed a question to the 300,000 users\nof the page at the time:\n\"Today is the 14th of January.\nThe 25th of January is Police Day.\nIt's a national holiday.\nIf 100,000 of us take\nto the streets of Cairo,\nno one is going to stop us.\nI wonder if we could do it.\"\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nIn just a few days, the invitation\nreached over a million people,\nand over 100,000 people\nconfirmed attendance.\nSocial media was crucial\nfor this campaign.\nIt helped a decentralized movement arise.\nIt made people realize\nthat they were not alone.\nAnd it made it impossible\nfor the regime to stop it.\nAt the time, they didn't\neven understand it.\nAnd on January 25th, Egyptians flooded\nthe streets of Cairo and other cities,\ncalling for change,\nbreaking the barrier of fear\nand announcing a new era.\n\n\n\n 4:32\n\n\nThen came the consequences.\nA few hours before the regime cut off\nthe Internet and telecommunications,\nI was walking in a dark street\nin Cairo, around midnight.\nI had just tweeted, \"Pray for Egypt.\nThe government must be planning\na massacre tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n 4:52\n\n\nI was hit hard on my head.\nI lost my balance and fell down,\nto find four armed men surrounding me.\nOne covered my mouth\nand the others paralyzed me.\nI knew I was being kidnapped\nby state security.\n\n\n\n 5:09\n\n\nI found myself in a cell,\nhandcuffed, blindfolded.\nI was terrified.\nSo was my family,\nwho started looking for me\nin hospitals, police stations\nand even morgues.\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nAfter my disappearance,\na few of my fellow colleagues who knew\nI was the admin of the page\ntold the media about\nmy connection with that page,\nand that I was likely arrested\nby state security.\nMy colleagues at Google started\na search campaign trying to find me,\nand the fellow protesters in the square\ndemanded my release.\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\nAfter 11 days of complete darkness,\nI was set free.\nAnd three days later,\nMubarak was forced to step down.\nIt was the most inspiring\nand empowering moment of my life.\nIt was a time of great hope.\nEgyptians lived a utopia for 18 days\nduring the revolution.\nThey all shared the belief\nthat we could actually live together\ndespite our differences,\nthat Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.\n\n\n\n 6:18\n\n\nBut unfortunately,\nthe post-revolution events\nwere like a punch in the gut.\nThe euphoria faded,\nwe failed to build consensus,\nand the political struggle\nled to intense polarization.\nSocial media only amplified that state,\nby facilitating the spread\nof misinformation, rumors,\necho chambers and hate speech.\nThe environment was purely toxic.\nMy online world became a battleground\nfilled with trolls, lies, hate speech.\nI started to worry\nabout the safety of my family.\nBut of course, this wasn't just about me.\nThe polarization reached its peak\nbetween the two main powers —\nthe army supporters and the Islamists.\nPeople in the center, like me,\nstarted feeling helpless.\nBoth groups wanted you to side with them;\nyou were either with them or against them.\nAnd on the 3rd of July 2013,\nthe army ousted Egypt's first\ndemocratically elected president,\nafter three days of popular protest\nthat demanded his resignation.\n\n\n\n 7:33\n\n\nThat day I made a very hard decision.\nI decided to go silent, completely silent.\nIt was a moment of defeat.\nI stayed silent for more than two years,\nand I used the time to reflect\non everything that happened,\ntrying to understand why did it happen.\nIt became clear to me\nthat while it's true that polarization\nis primarily driven\nby our human behavior,\nsocial media shapes this behavior\nand magnifies its impact.\nSay you want to say something\nthat is not based on a fact,\npick a fight or ignore\nsomeone that you don't like.\nThese are all natural human impulses,\nbut because of technology,\nacting on these impulses\nis only one click away.\n\n\n\n 8:23\n\n\nIn my view, there are five\ncritical challenges\nfacing today's social media.\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\nFirst, we don't know\nhow to deal with rumors.\nRumors that confirm people's biases\nare now believed and spread\namong millions of people.\n\n\n\n 8:41\n\n\nSecond, we create our own echo chambers.\nWe tend to only communicate\nwith people that we agree with,\nand thanks to social media,\nwe can mute, un-follow\nand block everybody else.\n\n\n\n 8:57\n\n\nThird, online discussions\nquickly descend into angry mobs.\nAll of us probably know that.\nIt's as if we forget\nthat the people behind screens\nare actually real people\nand not just avatars.\n\n\n\n 9:12\n\n\nAnd fourth, it became really hard\nto change our opinions.\nBecause of the speed\nand brevity of social media,\nwe are forced to jump to conclusions\nand write sharp opinions in 140 characters\nabout complex world affairs.\nAnd once we do that,\nit lives forever on the Internet,\nand we are less motivated\nto change these views,\neven when new evidence arises.\n\n\n\n 9:39\n\n\nFifth — and in my point of view,\nthis is the most critical —\ntoday, our social media experiences\nare designed in a way\nthat favors broadcasting over engagements,\nposts over discussions,\nshallow comments over deep conversations.\nIt's as if we agreed that\nwe are here to talk at each other\ninstead of talking with each other.\n\n\n\n10:04\n\n\nI witnessed how these\ncritical challenges contributed\nto an already polarized\nEgyptian society,\nbut this is not just about Egypt.\nPolarization is on the rise\nin the whole world.\nWe need to work hard on figuring out\nhow technology could be\npart of the solution,\nrather than part of the problem.\n\n\n\n10:26\n\n\nThere's a lot of debate today\non how to combat online harassment\nand fight trolls.\nThis is so important.\nNo one could argue against that.\nBut we need to also think about how\nto design social media experiences\nthat promote civility\nand reward thoughtfulness.\nI know for a fact\nif I write a post\nthat is more sensational,\nmore one-sided, sometimes\nangry and aggressive,\nI get to have more people see that post.\nI will get more attention.\n\n\n\n10:58\n\n\nBut what if we put more focus on quality?\nWhat is more important:\nthe total number of readers\nof a post you write,\nor who are the people who have impact\nthat read what you write?\nCouldn't we just give people more\nincentives to engage in conversations,\nrather than just broadcasting\nopinions all the time?\nOr reward people for reading\nand responding to views\nthat they disagree with?\nAnd also, make it socially acceptable\nthat we change our minds,\nor probably even reward that?\nWhat if we have a matrix that says\nhow many people changed their minds,\nand that becomes part\nof our social media experience?\nIf I could track how many people\nare changing their minds,\nI'd probably write more\nthoughtfully, trying to do that,\nrather than appealing to the people\nwho already agree with me\nand \"liking\" because I just\nconfirmed their biases.\n\n\n\n11:54\n\n\nWe also need to think about effective\ncrowdsourcing mechanisms,\nto fact-check widely spread\nonline information,\nand reward people who take part in that.\nIn essence, we need to rethink\ntoday's social media ecosystem\nand redesign its experiences\nto reward thoughtfulness, civility\nand mutual understanding.\n\n\n\n12:16\n\n\nAs a believer in the Internet,\nI teamed up with a few friends,\nstarted a new project,\ntrying to find answers\nand explore possibilities.\nOur first product is a new\nmedia platform for conversations.\nWe're hosting conversations\nthat promote mutual understanding\nand hopefully change minds.\nWe don't claim to have the answers,\nbut we started experimenting\nwith different discussions\nabout very divisive issues,\nsuch as race, gun control,\nthe refugee debate,\nrelationship between Islam and terrorism.\nThese are conversations that matter.\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\nToday, at least one out of three\npeople on the planet\nhave access to the Internet.\nBut part of this Internet\nis being held captive\nby the less noble aspects\nof our human behavior.\n\n\n\n13:09\n\n\nFive years ago, I said,\n\"If you want to liberate society,\nall you need is the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n13:18\n\n\nToday, I believe if we want\nto liberate society,\nwe first need to liberate the Internet.\n\n\n\n13:26\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n13:27\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nLet's say you despise\nWestern democracy.\nDemocracy, in all its trappings,\nfree elections, town halls,\nendless debates about\nthe proper role of government.\nToo messy,\ntoo unpredictable,\ntoo constraining for your taste.\nAnd the way these democracies\nband together and lecture everyone else\nabout individual rights and freedoms —\nit gets under your skin.\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\nSo what to do about it?\nYou can call out the hypocrisy\nand failures of Western democracies\nand explain how your way is better,\nbut that's never really worked for you.\nWhat if you could get the people\nwhose support is the very foundation\nof these democracies\nto start questioning the system?\nMake the idea occur in their own minds\nthat democracy and its institutions\nare failing them,\ntheir elite are corrupt puppet masters\nand the country they knew is in free fall.\nTo do that,\nyou'll need to infiltrate\nthe information spheres\nof these democracies.\nYou'll need to turn\ntheir most powerful asset —\nan open mind —\ninto their greatest vulnerability.\nYou'll need people to question the truth.\n\n\n\n 1:35\n\n\nNow, you'll be familiar of hacking\nand leaks that happened in 2016.\nOne was the Democratic\nNational Committee's networks,\nand the personal email\naccounts of its staff,\nlater released on WikiLeaks.\nAfter that, various online personas,\nlike a supposed Romanian cybercriminal\nwho didn't speak Romanian,\naggressively pushed news\nof these leaks to journalists.\nThe media took the bait.\nThey were consumed by how much\nthe DNC hated Bernie.\nAt the time, it was that narrative\nthat far outshined the news\nthat a group of Russian government\nsponsored hackers\nwho we called \"Advanced\nPersistent Threat 28,\"\nor \"APT28\" for short,\nwas carrying out\nthese operations against the US.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nAnd there was no shortage of evidence.\nThis group of Russian government hackers\nhadn't just appeared out of nowhere\nin 2016.\nWe had started tracking\nthis group back in 2014.\nAnd the tools that APT28 used\nto compromise its victims' networks\ndemonstrated a thoughtful,\nwell-resourced effort\nthat had taken place for now over a decade\nin Moscow's time zone\nfrom about 9 am to 6 pm.\nAPT28 loved to prey on the emails\nand contacts of journalists in Chechnya,\nthe Georgian government,\neastern European defense attachés —\nall targets with an undeniable interest\nto the Russian government.\n\n\n\n 3:02\n\n\nWe weren't the only ones onto this.\nGovernments, research teams\nacross the world,\nwere coming to similar conclusions\nand observing the same\ntypes of operations.\nBut what Russia was doing in 2016\nwent far beyond espionage.\nThe DNC hack was just one of many\nwhere stolen data was posted online\naccompanied by a sensational narrative,\nthen amplified in social media\nfor lightning-speed adoption by the media.\nThis didn't ring the alarm bells\nthat a nation-state was trying\nto interfere with the credibility\nof another's internal affairs.\n\n\n\n 3:44\n\n\nSo why, collectively,\ndid we not see this coming?\nWhy did it take months\nbefore Americans understood\nthat they were under a state-sponsored\ninformation attack?\nThe easy answer is politics.\nThe Obama Administration was caught\nin a perfect catch-22.\nBy raising the specter that the Russian\ngovernment was interfering\nin the US presidential campaign,\nthe Administration risked appearing\nto meddle in the campaign itself.\nBut the better answer, I think,\nis that the US and the West\nwere utterly unequipped\nto recognize and respond\nto a modern information operation,\ndespite the fact that the US\nhad wielded information\nwith devastating success\nin an era not so long ago.\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nLook, so while the US and the West\nspent the last 20 years\ncaught up in cybersecurity —\nwhat networks to harden,\nwhich infrastructure to deem critical,\nhow to set up armies of cyber warriors\nand cyber commands —\nRussia was thinking in far more\nconsequential terms.\nBefore the first iPhone\neven hit the shelf,\nthe Russian government understood\nthe risks and the opportunity\nthat technology provided\nand the inter-communication\nand instant communication it provided us.\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\nAs our realities are increasingly\nbased on the information\nthat we're consuming\nat the palm of our hand\nand from the news feeds\nthat we're scanning\nand the hashtags and stories\nthat we see trending,\nthe Russian government\nwas the first to recognize\nhow this evolution\nhad turned your mind into the most\nexploitable device on the planet.\nAnd your mind is particularly exploitable\nif you're accustomed\nto an unfettered flow of information,\nnow increasingly curated\nto your own tastes.\nThis panorama of information\nthat's so interesting to you\ngives a state, or anyone for that matter,\na perfect back door into your mind.\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nIt's this new brand of state-sponsored\ninformation operations\nthat can be that much more successful,\nmore insidious,\nand harder for the target audience —\nthat includes the media —\nto decipher and characterize.\nIf you can get a hashtag\ntrending on Twitter,\nor chum the waters with fake news\ndirected to audiences\nprimed to receive it,\nor drive journalists to dissect\nterabytes of email\nfor a cent of impropriety —\nall tactics used in Russian operations —\nthen you've got a shot at effectively\ncamouflaging your operations\nin the mind of your target.\nThis is what Russia's long called\n\"reflexive control.\"\nIt's the ability to use\ninformation on someone else\nso that they make a decision\non their own accord\nthat's favorable to you.\nThis is nation-state-grade image control\nand perception management,\nand it's conducted by any means,\nwith any tools, network-based\nor otherwise, that will achieve it.\n\n\n\n 7:00\n\n\nTake this for another example.\nIn early February 2014, a few weeks\nbefore Russia would invade Crimea,\na phone call is posted on YouTube.\nIn it, there's two US diplomats.\nThey sound like they're playing\nkingmaker in Ukraine,\nand worse, they curse the EU\nfor its lack of speed and leadership\nin resolving the crisis.\nThe media covers the phone call,\nand then the ensuing diplomatic backlash\nleaves Washington and Europe reeling.\nAnd it creates a fissured response\nand a feckless attitude\ntowards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.\nMission accomplished.\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\nSo while hacked phone calls\nand emails and networks\nkeep grabbing the headlines,\nthe real operations are the ones\nthat are influencing\nthe decisions you make\nand the opinions you hold,\nall in the service of a nation-state's\nstrategic interest.\nThis is power in the information age.\nAnd this information is all\nthat much more seductive,\nall that much easier to take\nat face value and pass on,\nwhen it's authentic.\nWho's not interested in the truth\nthat's presented in phone calls and emails\nthat were never intended\nfor public consumption?\nBut how meaningful is that truth\nif you don't know why\nit's being revealed to you?\n\n\n\n 8:26\n\n\nWe must recognize that this place\nwhere we're increasingly living,\nwhich we've quaintly termed \"cyberspace,\"\nisn't defined by ones and zeroes,\nbut by information\nand the people behind it.\nThis is far more than a network\nof computers and devices.\nThis is a network composed of minds\ninteracting with computers and devices.\n\n\n\n 8:49\n\n\nAnd for this network,\nthere's no encryption,\nthere's no firewall,\nno two-factor authentication,\nno password complex enough to protect you.\nWhat you have for defense\nis far stronger, it's more adaptable,\nit's always running the latest version.\nIt's the ability to think critically:\ncall out falsehood,\npress for the facts.\nAnd above all, you must have the courage\nto unflinchingly pursue the truth.\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nToday I want to talk\nabout the meaning of words,\nhow we define them\nand how they, almost as revenge,\ndefine us.\n\n\n\n 0:20\n\n\nThe English language\nis a magnificent sponge.\nI love the English language.\nI'm glad that I speak it.\nBut for all that, it has a lot of holes.\nIn Greek, there's a word, \"lachesism\"\nwhich is the hunger for disaster.\nYou know, when you see\na thunderstorm on the horizon\nand you just find yourself\nrooting for the storm.\nIn Mandarin, they have a word \"yù yī\" —\nI'm not pronouncing that correctly —\nwhich means the longing\nto feel intensely again\nthe way you did when you were a kid.\nIn Polish, they have a word \"jouska\"\nwhich is the kind of\nhypothetical conversation\nthat you compulsively\nplay out in your head.\nAnd finally, in German,\nof course in German,\nthey have a word called \"zielschmerz\"\nwhich is the dread\nof getting what you want.\n\n\n\n 1:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:19\n\n\nFinally fulfilling a lifelong dream.\nI'm German myself,\nso I know exactly what that feels like.\n\n\n\n 1:26\n\n\nNow, I'm not sure\nif I would use any of these words\nas I go about my day,\nbut I'm really glad they exist.\nBut the only reason they exist\nis because I made them up.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nI am the author of \"The Dictionary\nof Obscure Sorrows,\"\nwhich I've been writing\nfor the last seven years.\nAnd the whole mission of the project\nis to find holes\nin the language of emotion\nand try to fill them\nso that we have a way of talking\nabout all those human peccadilloes\nand quirks of the human condition\nthat we all feel\nbut may not think to talk about\nbecause we don't have the words to do it.\n\n\n\n 2:04\n\n\nAnd about halfway through this project,\nI defined \"sonder,\"\nthe idea that we all think of ourselves\nas the main character\nand everyone else is just extras.\nBut in reality,\nwe're all the main character,\nand you yourself are an extra\nin someone else's story.\nAnd so as soon as I published that,\nI got a lot of response from people\nsaying, \"Thank you for giving voice\nto something I had felt all my life\nbut there was no word for that.\"\nSo it made them feel less alone.\nThat's the power of words,\nto make us feel less alone.\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nAnd it was not long after that\nthat I started to notice sonder\nbeing used earnestly\nin conversations online,\nand not long after I actually noticed it,\nI caught it next to me\nin an actual conversation in person.\nThere is no stranger feeling\nthan making up a word\nand then seeing it\ntake on a mind of its own.\nI don't have a word\nfor that yet, but I will.\n\n\n\n 3:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\nI'm working on it.\n\n\n\n 3:10\n\n\nI started to think\nabout what makes words real,\nbecause a lot of people ask me,\nthe most common thing\nI got from people is,\n\"Well, are these words made up?\nI don't really understand.\"\nAnd I didn't really know what to tell them\nbecause once sonder started to take off,\nwho am I to say what words\nare real and what aren't.\nAnd so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,\nwho described his epiphany\nas when he realized that most of us,\nas we go through the day,\nwe just try to avoid\nbouncing against the walls too much\nand just sort of get on with things.\nBut once you realize that people —\nthat this world was built\nby people no smarter than you,\nthen you can reach out\nand touch those walls\nand even put your hand through them\nand realize that you have\nthe power to change it.\n\n\n\n 3:58\n\n\nAnd when people ask me,\n\"Are these words real?\"\nI had a variety of answers\nthat I tried out.\nSome of them made sense.\nSome of them didn't.\nBut one of them I tried out was,\n\"Well, a word is real\nif you want it to be real.\"\nThe way that this path is real\nbecause people wanted it to be there.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:17\n\n\nIt happens on college\ncampuses all the time.\nIt's called a \"desire path.\"\n\n\n\n 4:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:21\n\n\nBut then I decided,\nwhat people are really asking\nwhen they're asking if a word is real,\nthey're really asking,\n\"Well, how many brains\nwill this give me access to?\"\nBecause I think that's\na lot of how we look at language.\nA word is essentially a key\nthat gets us into certain people's heads.\nAnd if it gets us into one brain,\nit's not really worth it,\nnot really worth knowing.\nTwo brains, eh, it depends on who it is.\nA million brains, OK, now we're talking.\nAnd so a real word is one that gets you\naccess to as many brains as you can.\nThat's what makes it worth knowing.\n\n\n\n 5:01\n\n\nIncidentally, the realest word of all\nby this measure is this.\n\n\n\n 5:05\n\n\n[O.K.]\n\n\n\n 5:07\n\n\nThat's it.\nThe realest word we have.\nThat is the closest thing we have\nto a master key.\nThat's the most commonly\nunderstood word in the world,\nno matter where you are.\nThe problem with that is,\nno one seems to know\nwhat those two letters stand for.\n\n\n\n 5:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\nWhich is kind of weird, right?\nI mean, it could be a misspelling\nof \"all correct,\" I guess,\nor \"old kinderhook.\"\nNo one really seems to know,\nbut the fact that it doesn't matter\nsays something about\nhow we add meaning to words.\nThe meaning is not\nin the words themselves.\nWe're the ones\nthat pour ourselves into it.\n\n\n\n 5:44\n\n\nAnd I think, when we're all searching\nfor meaning in our lives,\nand searching for the meaning of life,\nI think words have\nsomething to do with that.\nAnd I think if you're looking\nfor the meaning of something,\nthe dictionary is a decent place to start.\nIt brings a sense of order\nto a very chaotic universe.\nOur view of things is so limited\nthat we have to come up\nwith patterns and shorthands\nand try to figure out\na way to interpret it\nand be able to get on with our day.\nWe need words to contain us,\nto define ourselves.\n\n\n\n 6:20\n\n\nI think a lot of us feel boxed in\nby how we use these words.\nWe forget that words are made up.\nIt's not just my words.\nAll words are made up,\nbut not all of them mean something.\nWe're all just sort of\ntrapped in our own lexicons\nthat don't necessarily correlate\nwith people who aren't already like us,\nand so I think I feel us drifting apart\na little more every year,\nthe more seriously we take words.\n\n\n\n 6:50\n\n\nBecause remember, words are not real.\nThey don't have meaning. We do.\n\n\n\n 6:57\n\n\nAnd I'd like to leave you with a reading\nfrom one of my favorite philosophers,\nBill Watterson, who created\n\"Calvin and Hobbes.\"\nHe said,\n\"Creating a life that reflects\nyour values and satisfies your soul\nis a rare achievement.\nTo invent your own life's meaning\nis not easy,\nbut it is still allowed,\nand I think you'll be\nhappier for the trouble.\"\n\n\n\n 7:22\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 7:23\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nHow many people here would like to live\nto be at least 80 years old?\nYeah.\nI think we all have\nthis hopeful expectation\nof living into old age.\nLet's project out into the future,\nto your future \"you's,\"\nand let's imagine that we're all 85.\nNow, everyone look at two people.\nOne of you probably has\nAlzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\nAlright, alright.\nAnd maybe you're thinking,\n\"Well, it won't be me.\"\nThen, OK. You are a caregiver.\nSo —\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:56\n\n\nso in some way,\nthis terrifying disease\nis likely to affect us all.\n\n\n\n 1:01\n\n\nPart of the fear around Alzheimer's\nstems from the sense\nthat there's nothing we can do about it.\nDespite decades of research, we still\nhave no disease-modifying treatment\nand no cure.\nSo if we're lucky enough\nto live long enough,\nAlzheimer's appears to be\nour brain's destiny.\n\n\n\n 1:20\n\n\nBut maybe it doesn't have to be.\nWhat if I told you we could\nchange these statistics,\nliterally change our brain's destiny,\nwithout relying on a cure\nor advancements in medicine?\n\n\n\n 1:32\n\n\nLet's begin by looking at\nwhat we currently understand\nabout the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.\nHere's a picture\nof two neurons connecting.\nThe point of connection,\nthis space circled in red,\nis called the synapse.\nThe synapse is where\nneurotransmitters are released.\nThis is where signals are transmitted,\nwhere communication happens.\nThis is where we think,\nfeel, see, hear, desire ...\nand remember.\nAnd the synapse\nis where Alzheimer's happens.\n\n\n\n 2:04\n\n\nLet's zoom in on the synapse\nand look at a cartoon representation\nof what's going on.\nDuring the business\nof communicating information,\nin addition to releasing neurotransmitters\nlike glutamate into the synapse,\nneurons also release a small peptide\ncalled amyloid beta.\nNormally, amyloid beta is cleared away\nmetabolized by microglia,\nthe janitor cells of our brains.\nWhile the molecular causes\nof Alzheimer's are still debated,\nmost neuroscientists believe\nthat the disease begins\nwhen amyloid beta begins to accumulate.\nToo much is released,\nor not enough is cleared away,\nand the synapse begins\nto pile up with amyloid beta.\nAnd when this happens, it binds to itself,\nforming sticky aggregates\ncalled amyloid plaques.\n\n\n\n 2:52\n\n\nHow many people here\nare 40 years old or older?\nYou're afraid to admit it now.\nThis initial step into the disease,\nthis presence of amyloid\nplaques accumulating,\ncan already be found in your brains.\nThe only way we could be sure of this\nwould be through a PET scan,\nbecause at this point,\nyou are blissfully unaware.\nYou're not showing any impairments\nin memory, language, or cognition ...\nyet.\nWe think it takes at least 15 to 20 years\nof amyloid plaque accumulation\nbefore it reaches a tipping point,\nthen triggering a molecular cascade\nthat causes the clinical\nsymptoms of the disease.\nPrior to the tipping point,\nyour lapses in memory\nmight include things like,\n\"Why did I come in this room?\"\nor \"Oh ... what's his name?\"\nor \"Where did I put my keys?\"\n\n\n\n 3:46\n\n\nNow, before you all\nstart freaking out again,\nbecause I know half of you did at least\none of those in the last 24 hours —\nthese are all normal kinds of forgetting.\nIn fact, I would argue that these examples\nmight not even involve your memory,\nbecause you didn't pay attention\nto where you put your keys\nin the first place.\nAfter the tipping point,\nthe glitches in memory,\nlanguage and cognition are different.\nInstead of eventually finding\nyour keys in your coat pocket\nor on the table by the door,\nyou find them in the refrigerator,\nor you find them and you think,\n\"What are these for?\"\n\n\n\n 4:23\n\n\nSo what happens when amyloid plaques\naccumulate to this tipping point?\nOur microglia janitor cells\nbecome hyper-activated,\nreleasing chemicals that cause\ninflammation and cellular damage.\nWe think they might actually\nstart clearing away\nthe synapses themselves.\nA crucial neural transport protein\ncalled \"tau\" becomes hyperphosphorylated\nand twists itself\ninto something called \"tangles,\"\nwhich choke off the neurons\nfrom the inside.\nBy mid-stage Alzheimer's,\nwe have massive inflammation and tangles\nand all-out war at the synapse\nand cell death.\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nSo if you were a scientist\ntrying to cure this disease,\nat what point would you ideally\nwant to intervene?\nMany scientists are betting big\non the simplest solution:\nkeep amyloid plaques\nfrom reaching that tipping point,\nwhich means that drug discovery is largely\nfocused on developing a compound\nthat will prevent, eliminate, or reduce\namyloid plaque accumulation.\nSo the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be\na preventative medicine.\nWe're going to have to take this pill\nbefore we reach that tipping point,\nbefore the cascade is triggered,\nbefore we start leaving\nour keys in the refrigerator.\nWe think this is why, to date,\nthese kinds of drugs have failed\nin clinical trials —\nnot because the science wasn't sound,\nbut because the people in these trials\nwere already symptomatic.\nIt was too late.\nThink of amyloid plaques as a lit match.\nAt the tipping point, the match\nsets fire to the forest.\nOnce the forest is ablaze,\nit doesn't do any good\nto blow out the match.\nYou have to blow out the match\nbefore the forest catches fire.\n\n\n\n 6:07\n\n\nEven before scientists sort this out,\nthis information is actually\nreally good news for us,\nbecause it turns out that the way we live\ncan influence the accumulation\nof amyloid plaques.\nAnd so there are things we can do\nto keep us from reaching\nthat tipping point.\n\n\n\n 6:22\n\n\nLet's picture your risk\nof Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.\nWe're going to pile\nrisk factors on one arm,\nand when that arm hits the floor,\nyou are symptomatic\nand diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\nLet's imagine you're 50 years old.\nYou're not a spring chicken anymore,\nso you've accumulated\nsome amyloid plaques with age.\nYour scale is tipped a little bit.\n\n\n\n 6:43\n\n\nNow let's look at your DNA.\nWe've all inherited our genes\nfrom our moms and our dads.\nSome of these genes will increase our risk\nand some will decrease it.\nIf you're like Alice in \"Still Alice,\"\nyou've inherited a rare genetic mutation\nthat cranks out amyloid beta,\nand this alone will tip\nyour scale arm to the ground.\nBut for most of us, the genes we inherit\nwill only tip the arm a bit.\nFor example, APOE4 is a gene variant\nthat increases amyloid,\nbut you can inherit a copy of APOE4\nfrom mom and dad\nand still never get Alzheimer's,\nwhich means that for most of us,\nour DNA alone does not determine\nwhether we get Alzheimer's.\nSo what does?\nWe can't do anything about getting older\nor the genes we've inherited.\nSo far, we haven't changed\nour brain's destiny.\n\n\n\n 7:34\n\n\nWhat about sleep?\nIn slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells\nrinse cerebral spinal fluid\nthroughout our brains,\nclearing away metabolic waste\nthat accumulated in our synapses\nwhile we were awake.\nDeep sleep is like\na power cleanse for the brain.\nBut what happens if you shortchange\nyourself on sleep?\nMany scientists believe\nthat poor sleep hygiene might actually\nbe a predictor of Alzheimer's.\nA single night of sleep deprivation\nleads to an increase in amyloid beta.\nAnd amyloid accumulation\nhas been shown to disrupt sleep,\nwhich in turn causes\nmore amyloid to accumulate.\nAnd so now we have\nthis positive feedback loop\nthat's going to accelerate\nthe tipping of that scale.\n\n\n\n 8:18\n\n\nWhat else?\nCardiovascular health.\nHigh blood pressure, diabetes,\nobesity, smoking, high cholesterol,\nhave all been shown to increase our risk\nof developing Alzheimer's.\nSome autopsy studies have shown\nthat as many as 80 percent\nof people with Alzheimer's\nalso had cardiovascular disease.\nAerobic exercise has been shown\nin many studies to decrease amyloid beta\nin animal models of the disease.\nSo a heart-healthy\nMediterranean lifestyle and diet\ncan help to counter\nthe tipping of this scale.\n\n\n\n 8:51\n\n\nSo there are many things we can do\nto prevent or delay\nthe onset of Alzheimer's.\nBut let's say\nyou haven't done any of them.\nLet's say you're 65;\nthere's Alzheimer's in your family,\nso you've likely inherited a gene or two\nthat tips your scale arm a bit;\nyou've been burning the candle\nat both ends for years;\nyou love bacon;\nand you don't run unless\nsomeone's chasing you.\n\n\n\n 9:13\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:15\n\n\nLet's imagine that your amyloid plaques\nhave reached that tipping point.\nYour scale arm has crashed to the floor.\nYou've tripped the cascade,\nsetting fire to the forest,\ncausing inflammation, tangles,\nand cell death.\nYou should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.\nYou should be having trouble\nfinding words and keys\nand remembering what I said\nat the beginning of this talk.\nBut you might not be.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nThere's one more thing you can do\nto protect yourself\nfrom experiencing\nthe symptoms of Alzheimer's,\neven if you have the full-blown disease\npathology ablaze in your brain.\nIt has to do with neural plasticity\nand cognitive reserve.\nRemember, the experience\nof having Alzheimer's\nis ultimately a result of losing synapses.\nThe average brain has\nover a hundred trillion synapses,\nwhich is fantastic;\nwe've got a lot to work with.\nAnd this isn't a static number.\nWe gain and lose synapses all the time,\nthrough a process\ncalled neural plasticity.\nEvery time we learn something new,\nwe are creating and strengthening\nnew neural connections,\nnew synapses.\n\n\n\n10:21\n\n\nIn the Nun Study,\n678 nuns, all over the age of 75\nwhen the study began,\nwere followed for more than two decades.\nThey were regularly given\nphysical checkups and cognitive tests,\nand when they died, their brains\nwere all donated for autopsy.\nIn some of these brains, scientists\ndiscovered something surprising.\nDespite the presence of plaques\nand tangles and brain shrinkage —\nwhat appeared to be\nunquestionable Alzheimer's —\nthe nuns who had belonged\nto these brains showed no signs\nof having the disease\nwhile they were alive.\n\n\n\n10:57\n\n\nHow can this be?\nWe think it's because these nuns\nhad a high level of cognitive reserve,\nwhich is a way of saying that they had\nmore functional synapses.\nPeople who have more years\nof formal education,\nwho have a high degree of literacy,\nwho engage regularly\nin mentally stimulating activities,\nall have more cognitive reserve.\nThey have an abundance\nand a redundancy in neural connections.\nSo even if they have a disease\nlike Alzheimer's\ncompromising some of their synapses,\nthey've got many extra backup connections,\nand this buffers them from noticing\nthat anything is amiss.\n\n\n\n11:33\n\n\nLet's imagine a simplified example.\nLet's say you only know one thing\nabout a subject.\nLet's say it's about me.\nYou know that Lisa Genova\nwrote \"Still Alice,\"\nand that's the only thing\nyou know about me.\nYou have that single neural connection,\nthat one synapse.\nNow imagine you have Alzheimer's.\nYou have plaques and tangles\nand inflammation\nand microglia devouring that synapse.\nNow when someone asks you,\n\"Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'\"\nyou can't remember,\nbecause that synapse\nis either failing or gone.\nYou've forgotten me forever.\n\n\n\n12:08\n\n\nBut what if you had learned more about me?\nLet's say you learned\nfour things about me.\nNow imagine you have Alzheimer's,\nand three of those synapses\nare damaged or destroyed.\nYou still have a way\nto detour the wreckage.\nYou can still remember my name.\nSo we can be resilient\nto the presence of Alzheimer's pathology\nthrough the recruitment\nof yet-undamaged pathways.\nAnd we create these pathways,\nthis cognitive reserve,\nby learning new things.\nIdeally, we want these new things\nto be as rich in meaning as possible,\nrecruiting sight and sound\nand associations and emotion.\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\nSo this really doesn't mean\ndoing crossword puzzles.\nYou don't want to simply retrieve\ninformation you've already learned,\nbecause this is like traveling\ndown old, familiar streets,\ncruising neighborhoods you already know.\nYou want to pave new neural roads.\nBuilding an Alzheimer's-resistant brain\nmeans learning to speak Italian,\nmeeting new friends,\nreading a book,\nor listening to a great TED Talk.\n\n\n\n13:14\n\n\nAnd if, despite all of this, you are\nsomeday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,\nthere are three lessons I've learned\nfrom my grandmother\nand the dozens of people I've come to know\nliving with this disease.\nDiagnosis doesn't mean\nyou're dying tomorrow.\nKeep living.\nYou won't lose your emotional memory.\nYou'll still be able\nto understand love and joy.\nYou might not remember\nwhat I said five minutes ago,\nbut you'll remember how I made you feel.\nAnd you are more than what\nyou can remember.\n\n\n\n13:47\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:48\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhat is a parent?\n\n\n\n 0:14\n\n\nWhat is a parent?\n\n\n\n 0:18\n\n\nIt's not an easy question.\nToday we have adoption,\nstepfamilies,\nsurrogate mothers.\nMany parents face tough questions\nand tough decisions.\nShall we tell our child\nabout the sperm donation?\nIf so, when?\nWhat words to use?\nSperm donors are often referred\nto as \"biological fathers,\"\nbut should we really\nbe using the word \"father?\"\n\n\n\n 0:52\n\n\nAs a philosopher and social scientist,\nI have been studying these questions\nabout the concept of parenthood.\nBut today, I will talk to you\nabout what I learned\nfrom talking to parents and children.\nI will show you that they know\nwhat matters most in a family,\neven though their family\nlooks a little different.\nI will show you their creative ways\nof dealing with tough questions.\nBut I will also show you\nthe parents' uncertainties.\n\n\n\n 1:26\n\n\nWe interviewed couples\nwho received fertility treatment\nat Ghent University Hospital,\nusing sperm from a donor.\nIn this treatment timeline,\nyou can see two points\nat which we conducted interviews.\nWe included heterosexual couples,\nwhere the man for some reason\ndid not have good-quality sperm,\nand lesbian couples who obviously\nneeded to find sperm elsewhere.\nWe also included children.\nI wanted to know\nhow those children define concepts\nlike parenthood and family.\nIn fact, that is what I asked them,\nonly not in that way.\nI drew an apple tree instead.\nThis way, I could ask abstract,\nphilosophical questions\nin a way that did not make them run off.\n\n\n\n 2:24\n\n\nSo as you can see,\nthe apple tree is empty.\nAnd that illustrates my research approach.\nBy designing techniques like this,\nI can bring as little meaning and content\nas possible to the interview,\nbecause I want to hear that from them.\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nI asked them:\nWhat would your family look like\nif it were an apple tree?\nAnd they could take a paper apple\nfor everyone who, in their view,\nwas a member of the family,\nwrite a name on it\nand hang it wherever they wanted.\nAnd I would ask questions.\nMost children started\nwith a parent or a sibling.\nOne started with \"Boxer,\"\nthe dead dog of his grandparents.\n\n\n\n 3:10\n\n\nAt this point, none of the children\nstarted mentioning the donor.\nSo, I asked them about their birth story.\nI said, \"Before you were born,\nit was just your mom and dad,\nor mom and mommy.\nCan you tell me how you came\ninto the family?\"\nAnd they explained.\nOne said,\n\"My parents did not have good seeds,\nbut there are friendly men out there\nwho have spare seeds.\nThey bring them to the hospital,\nand they put them in a big jar.\nMy mommy went there,\nand she took two from the jar,\none for me and one for my sister.\nShe put the seeds in her belly —\nsomehow —\nand her belly grew really big,\nand there I was.\"\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\nHmm.\nSo only when they started\nmentioning the donor,\nI asked questions about him,\nusing their own words.\nI said,\n\"If this would be an apple\nfor the friendly man with the seeds,\nwhat would you do with it?\"\nAnd one boy was thinking out loud,\nholding the apple.\nAnd he said,\n\"I won't put this one\nup there with the others.\nHe's not part of my family.\nBut I will not put him on the ground.\nThat's too cold and too hard.\nI think he should be in the trunk,\nbecause he made my family possible.\nIf he would not have done this,\nthat would really be sad\nbecause my family would not be here,\nand I would not be here.\"\n\n\n\n 4:56\n\n\nSo also, parents\nconstructed family tales —\ntales to tell their children.\nOne couple explained their insemination\nby taking their children to a farm\nto watch a vet inseminate cows.\nAnd why not?\nIt's their way of explaining;\ntheir do-it-yourself\nwith family narratives.\nDIY.\nAnd we had another couple\nwho made books —\na book for each child.\nThey were really works of art\ncontaining their thoughts and feelings\nthroughout the treatment.\nThey even had the hospital\nparking tickets in there.\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\nSo it is DIY:\nfinding ways, words and images\nto tell your family story to your child.\nAnd these stories were highly diverse,\nbut they all had one thing in common:\nit was a tale of longing for a child\nand a quest for that child.\nIt was about how special\nand how deeply loved their child was.\nAnd research so far shows\nthat these children are doing fine.\nThey do not have\nmore problems than other kids.\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\nYet, these parents also wanted\nto justify their decisions\nthrough the tales they tell.\nThey hoped that their children\nwould understand their reasons\nfor making the family in this way.\nUnderlying was a fear\nthat their children might disapprove\nand would reject the non-genetic parent.\nAnd that fear is understandable,\nbecause we live in a very heteronormative\nand geneticized society —\na world that still believes\nthat true families consist\nof one mom, one dad\nand their genetically related children.\n\n\n\n 6:50\n\n\nWell.\nI want to tell you about a teenage boy.\nHe was donor-conceived\nbut not part of our study.\nOne day, he had an argument\nwith his father,\nand he yelled,\n\"You're telling me what to do?\nYou're not even my father!\"\nThat was exactly what\nthe parents in our study feared.\nNow, the boy soon felt sorry,\nand they made up.\nBut it is the reaction of his father\nthat is most interesting.\n\n\n\n 7:23\n\n\nHe said,\n\"This outburst had nothing to do\nwith the lack of a genetic link.\nIt was about puberty —\nbeing difficult.\nIt's what they do at that age.\nIt will pass.\"\n\n\n\n 7:40\n\n\nWhat this man shows us\nis that when something goes wrong,\nwe should not immediately think\nit is because the family\nis a little different.\nThese things happen in all families.\nAnd every now and then,\nall parents may wonder:\nAm I a good enough parent?\nThese parents, too.\nThey, above all, wanted to do\nwhat's best for their child.\nBut they also sometimes wondered:\nAm I a real parent?\nAnd their uncertainties were present\nlong before they even were parents.\n\n\n\n 8:17\n\n\nAt the start of treatment,\nwhen they first saw the counselor,\nthey paid close attention\nto the counselor,\nbecause they wanted to do it right.\nEven 10 years later,\nthey still remember\nthe advice they were given.\n\n\n\n 8:35\n\n\nSo when they thought about the counselor\nand the advice they were given,\nwe discussed that.\nAnd we saw one lesbian couple who said,\n\"When our son asks us,\n'Do I have a dad?'\nwe will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'\nBut we will say nothing more,\nnot unless he asks,\nbecause he might not be ready for that.\nThe counselor said so.\"\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nWell.\nI don't know; that's quite different\nfrom how we respond\nto children's questions.\nLike, \"Milk — is that made in a factory?\"\nWe will say, \"No, it comes from cows,\"\nand we will talk about the farmer,\nand the way the milk ends up in the shop.\nWe will not say,\n\"No, milk is not made in a factory.\"\nSo something strange happened here,\nand of course these children noticed that.\n\n\n\n 9:36\n\n\nOne boy said,\n\"I asked my parents loads of questions,\nbut they acted really weird.\nSo, you know, I have a friend at school,\nand she's made in the same way.\nWhen I have a question,\nI just go and ask her.\"\nClever guy.\nProblem solved.\nBut his parents did not notice,\nand it certainly was not\nwhat they had in mind,\nnor what the counselor had in mind\nwhen they were saying how important\nit is to be an open-communication family.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\nAnd that's the strange thing about advice.\nWhen we offer people pills,\nwe gather evidence first.\nWe do tests,\nwe do follow-up studies.\nWe want to know, and rightly so,\nwhat this pill is doing\nand how it affects people's lives.\nAnd advice?\nIt is not enough for advice,\nor for professionals to give advice\nthat is theoretically sound,\nor well-meant.\nIt should be advice\nthat there is evidence for —\nevidence that it actually\nimproves patients' lives.\n\n\n\n10:47\n\n\nSo the philosopher in me\nwould now like to offer you a paradox:\nI advise you to stop following advice.\nBut, yes.\n\n\n\n11:01\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:05\n\n\nI will not end here with what went wrong;\nI would not be doing justice\nto the warmth we found in those families.\nRemember the books\nand the trip to the farmer?\nWhen parents do things that work for them,\nthey do brilliant things.\nWhat I want you to remember\nas members of families,\nin no matter what form or shape,\nis that what families need\nare warm relationships.\nAnd we do not need to be\nprofessionals to create those.\nMost of us do just fine,\nalthough it may be hard work,\nand from time to time,\nwe can do with some advice.\n\n\n\n11:50\n\n\nIn that case,\nbear in mind three things.\nWork with advice\nthat works for your family.\nRemember — you're the expert,\nbecause you live your family life.\nAnd finally,\nbelieve in your abilities\nand your creativity,\nbecause you can do it yourself.\n\n\n\n12:16\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:17\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nGetting a college education\nis a 20-year investment.\nWhen you're growing up poor,\nyou're not accustomed\nto thinking that far ahead.\nInstead, you're thinking about\nwhere you're going to get your next meal\nand how your family\nis going to pay rent that month.\nBesides, my parents\nand my friends' parents\nseemed to be doing just fine\ndriving taxis and working as janitors.\nIt wasn't until I was a teenager\nwhen I realized I didn't\nwant to do those things.\nBy then, I was two-thirds of the way\nthrough my education,\nand it was almost too late\nto turn things around.\n\n\n\n 0:48\n\n\nWhen you grow up poor,\nyou want to be rich.\nI was no different.\nI'm the second-oldest of seven,\nand was raised by a single mother\non government aid\nin Queens, New York.\nBy virtue of growing up low-income,\nmy siblings and I went\nto some of New York City's\nmost struggling public schools.\nI had over 60 absences\nwhen I was in seventh grade,\nbecause I didn't feel like going to class.\nMy high school had\na 55 percent graduation rate,\nand even worse,\nonly 20 percent of the kids graduating\nwere college-ready.\n\n\n\n 1:21\n\n\nWhen I actually did make it to college,\nI told my friend Brennan\nhow our teachers would always ask us\nto raise our hands\nif we were going to college.\nI was taken aback when Brennan said,\n\"Karim, I've never been asked\nthat question before.\"\nIt was always, \"What college\nare you going to?\"\nJust the way that question is phrased\nmade it unacceptable for him\nnot to have gone to college.\n\n\n\n 1:46\n\n\nNowadays I get asked a different question.\n\"How were you able to make it out?\"\nFor years I said I was lucky,\nbut it's not just luck.\nWhen my older brother and I\ngraduated from high school\nat the very same time\nand he later dropped out\nof a two-year college,\nI wanted to understand why he dropped out\nand I kept studying.\nIt wasn't until I got to Cornell\nas a Presidential Research Scholar\nthat I started to learn about\nthe very real educational consequences\nof being raised by a single mother\non government aid\nand attending the schools that I did.\nThat's when my older brother's trajectory\nbegan to make complete sense to me.\n\n\n\n 2:27\n\n\nI also learned that our most admirable\neducation reformers,\npeople like Arne Duncan,\nthe former US Secretary of Education,\nor Wendy Kopp, the founder\nof Teach For America,\nhad never attended an inner city\npublic school like I had.\nSo much of our education reform\nis driven by a sympathetic approach,\nwhere people are saying,\n\"Let's go and help\nthese poor inner city kids,\nor these poor black and Latino kids,\"\ninstead of an empathetic approach,\nwhere someone like me, who had grown up\nin this environment, could say,\n\"I know the adversities that you're facing\nand I want to help you overcome them.\"\n\n\n\n 3:02\n\n\nToday when I get questions\nabout how I made it out,\nI share that one of the biggest reasons\nis that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.\nIn a typical middle class\nor affluent household,\nif a kid is struggling,\nthere's a good chance that a parent\nor a teacher will come to their rescue\neven if they don't ask for help.\nHowever, if that same kid\nis growing up poor\nand doesn't ask for help,\nthere's a good chance\nthat no one will help them.\nThere are virtually\nno social safety nets available.\n\n\n\n 3:32\n\n\nSo seven years ago,\nI started to reform\nour public education system\nshaped by my firsthand perspective.\nAnd I started with summer school.\nResearch tells us that two-thirds\nof the achievement gap,\nwhich is the disparity\nin educational attainment\nbetween rich kids and poor kids\nor black kids and white kids,\ncould be directly attributed\nto the summer learning loss.\nIn low-income neighborhoods,\nkids forget almost three months\nof what they learned\nduring the school year\nover the summer.\nThey return to school in the fall,\nand their teachers\nspend another two months\nreteaching them old material.\nThat's five months.\nThe school year in the United States\nis only 10 months.\nIf kids lose five months of learning\nevery single year,\nthat's half of their education.\nHalf.\n\n\n\n 4:19\n\n\nIf kids were in school over the summer,\nthen they couldn't regress,\nbut traditional summer school\nis poorly designed.\nFor kids it feels like punishment,\nand for teachers\nit feels like babysitting.\nBut how can we expect principals\nto execute an effective summer program\nwhen the school year\nends the last week of June\nand then summer school starts\njust one week later?\nThere just isn't enough time\nto find the right people,\nsort out the logistics,\nand design an engaging curriculum\nthat excites kids and teachers.\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\nBut what if we created a program\nover the summer\nthat empowered teachers\nas teaching coaches\nto develop aspiring educators?\nWhat if we empowered\ncollege-educated role models\nas teaching fellows\nto help kids realize\ntheir college ambitions?\nWhat if empowered high-achieving kids\nas mentors to tutor their younger peers\nand inspire them\nto invest in their education?\nWhat if we empowered all kids as scholars,\nasked them what colleges\nthey were going to,\ndesigned a summer school\nthey want to attend\nto completely eliminate\nthe summer learning loss\nand close two-thirds\nof the achievement gap?\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\nBy this summer, my team will have served\nover 4,000 low-income children,\ntrained over 300 aspiring teachers\nand created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs\nacross some of New York City's\nmost disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nAnd our kids are succeeding.\nTwo years of independent evaluations\ntell us that our kids\neliminate the summer learning loss\nand make growth of one month in math\nand two months in reading.\nSo instead of returning to school\nin the fall three months behind,\nthey now go back four months ahead in math\nand five months ahead in reading.\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:23\n\n\nTen years ago, if you would have told me\nthat I'd graduate in the top 10 percent\nof my class from an Ivy League institution\nand have an opportunity to make a dent\non our public education system\njust by tackling two months\nof the calendar year,\nI would have said,\n\"Nah. No way.\"\nWhat's even more exciting\nis that if we can prevent\nfive months of lost time\njust by redesigning two months,\nimagine the possibilities\nthat we can unlock\nby tackling the rest of the calendar year.\n\n\n\n 6:57\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 6:58\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

consent,\nbut that's where the conversation\nabout sex is ending.\nAnd in that vacuum of information\nthe media and the Internet —\nthat new digital street corner —\nare educating our kids for us.\nIf we truly want young people\nto engage safely, ethically,\nand yes, enjoyably,\nit's time to have open honest discussion\nabout what happens after \"yes,\"\nand that includes breaking\nthe biggest

1:05\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nI spent three years\ntalking to girls ages 15 to 20\nabout their attitudes\nand experience of sex.\nAnd what I found was\nthat while young women may feel\nentitled to engage in sexual behavior,\nthey don't necessarily\nfeel entitled to enjoy it.\nTake this sophomore\nat the Ivy League college\nwho told me,\n\"I come from a long line\nof smart, strong women.\nMy grandmother was a firecracker,\nmy mom is a professional,\nmy sister and I are loud,\nand that's our form of feminine power.\"\nShe then proceeded\nto describe her sex life to me:\na series of one-off hookups,\nstarting when she was 13,\nthat were ...\nnot especially responsible,\nnot especially reciprocal\nand not especially enjoyable.\nShe shrugged.\n\"I guess we girls are just socialized\nto be these docile creatures\nwho don't express our wants or needs.\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" I replied.\n\"Didn't you just tell me\nwhat a smart, strong woman you are?\"\nShe hemmed and hawed.\n\"I guess,\" she finally said,\n\"no one told me that that smart,\nstrong image applies to sex.\"\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nI should probably say right up top\nthat despite the hype,\nteenagers are not engaging in intercourse\nmore often or at a younger age\nthan they were 25 years ago.\nThey are, however,\nengaging in other behavior.\nAnd when we ignore that,\nwhen we label that as \"not sex,\"\nthat opens the door\nto risky behavior and disrespect.\nThat's particularly true of oral sex,\nwhich teenagers consider\nto be less intimate than intercourse.\nGirls would tell me, \"it's no big deal,\"\nlike they'd all read\nthe same instruction manual —\nat least if boys\nwere on the receiving end.\nYoung women have lots\nof reasons for participating.\nIt made them feel desired;\nit was a way to boost social status.\nSometimes, it was a way\nto get out of an uncomfortable situation.\nAs a freshman at a West Coast\ncollege said to me,\n\"A girl will give a guy a blow job\nat the end of the night\nbecause she doesn't\nwant to have sex with him,\nand he expects to be satisfied.\nSo, if I want him to leave\nand I don't want anything to happen ... \"\nI heard so many stories\nof girls performing one-sided oral sex\nthat I started asking,\n\"What if every time\nyou were alone with a guy,\nhe told you to get him\na glass of water from the kitchen,\nand he never got you a glass of water —\nor if he did, it was like ...\n'you want me to uh ...?'\"\nYou know, totally begrudging.\nYou wouldn't stand for it.\n\n\n\n 3:49\n\n\nBut it wasn't always\nthat boys didn't want to.\nIt was that girls didn't want them to.\nGirls expressed a sense of shame\naround their genitals.\nA sense that they were\nsimultaneously icky and sacred.\nWomen's feelings about their genitals\nhave been directly linked\nto their enjoyment of sex.\nYet, Debby Herbenick,\na researcher at Indiana University,\nbelieves that girls' genital\nself-image is under siege,\nwith more pressure than ever\nto see them as unacceptable\nin their natural state.\nAccording to research,\nabout three-quarters of college women\nremove their pubic hair — all of it —\nat least on occasion,\nand more than half do so regularly.\nGirls would tell me that hair removal\nmade them feel cleaner,\nthat it was a personal choice.\nThough, I kind of wondered\nif left alone on a desert island,\nif this was how they would\nchoose to spend their time.\n\n\n\n 4:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\nAnd when I pushed further,\na darker motivation emerged:\navoiding humiliation.\n\"Guys act like they\nwould be disgusted by it,\"\none young woman told me.\n\"No one wants to be\ntalked about like that.\"\nThe rising pubic hair removal\nreminded me of the 1920s,\nwhen women first started regularly\nshaving their armpits and their legs.\nThat's when flapper dresses\ncame into style,\nand women's limbs were suddenly visible,\nopen to public scrutiny.\nThere's a way that I think\nthat this too is a sign.\nThat a girl's most intimate part\nis open to public scrutiny,\nopen to critique,\nto becoming more about\nhow it looks to someone else\nthan how it feels to her.\n\n\n\n 5:37\n\n\nThe shaving trend has sparked\nanother rise in labiaplasty.\nLabiaplasty, which is the trimming\nof the inner and outer labia,\nis the fastest-growing cosmetic\nsurgery among teenage girls.\nIt rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,\nand whereas girls under 18 comprise\ntwo percent of all cosmetic surgeries,\nthey are five percent of labiaplasty.\nThe most sought-after look, incidentally,\nin which the outer labia\nappear fused like a clam shell,\nis called ...\nwait for it ...\n\"The Barbie.\"\n\n\n\n 6:15\n\n\n(Groan)\n\n\n\n 6:17\n\n\nI trust I don't have to tell you\nthat Barbie is a) made of plastic\nand b) has no genitalia.\n\n\n\n 6:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:27\n\n\nThe labiaplasty trend\nhas become so worrisome\nthat the American College\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nhas issued a statement on the procedure,\nwhich is rarely medically indicated,\nhas not been proven safe\nand whose side effects\ninclude scarring, numbness, pain\nand diminished sexual sensation.\nNow, admittedly,\nand blessedly,\nthe number of girls involved\nis still quite small,\nbut you could see them\nas canaries in a coal mine,\ntelling us something important\nabout the way girls see their bodies.\n\n\n\n 7:04\n\n\nSara McClelland,\na psychologist\nat the University of Michigan,\ncoined what is my favorite phrase ever\nin talking about all of this:\n\"Intimate justice.\"\nThat's the idea that sex has political,\nas well as personal implications,\njust like, who does\nthe dishes in your house,\nor who vacuums the rug.\nAnd it raises similar\nissues about inequality,\nabout economic disparity,\nviolence,\nphysical and mental health.\nIntimate justice asks us to consider\nwho is entitled\nto engage in an experience.\nWho is entitled to enjoy it?\nWho is the primary beneficiary?\nAnd how does each partner\ndefine \"good enough\"?\nHonestly, I think those questions\nare tricky and sometimes traumatic\nfor adult women to confront,\nbut when we're talking about girls,\nI just kept coming back to the idea\nthat their early sexual experience\nshouldn't have to be\nsomething that they get over.\n\n\n\n 8:12\n\n\nIn her work,\nMcClelland found that young women\nwere more likely than young men\nto use their partner's pleasure\nas a measure of their satisfaction.\nSo they'd say things like,\n\"If he's sexually satisfied,\nthen I'm sexually satisfied.\"\nYoung men were more likely to measure\ntheir satisfaction by their own orgasm.\nYoung women also defined\nbad sex differently.\nIn the largest ever survey\never conducted\non American sexual behavior,\nthey reported pain\nin their sexual encounters\n30 percent of the time.\nThey also used words like \"depressing,\"\n\"humiliating,\"\n\"degrading.\"\nThe young men never used that language.\nSo when young women\nreport sexual satisfaction levels\nthat are equal to\nor greater than young men's —\nand they do in research —\nthat can be deceptive.\nIf a girl goes into an encounter\nhoping that it won't hurt,\nwanting to feel close to her partner\nand expecting him to have an orgasm,\nshe'll be satisfied\nif those criteria are met.\nAnd there's nothing wrong with wanting\nto feel close to your partner,\nor wanting him to be happy,\nand orgasm isn't the only\nmeasure of an experience ...\nbut absence of pain —\nthat's a very low bar\nfor your own sexual fulfillment.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nListening to all of this\nand thinking about it,\nI began to realize that we performed\na kind of psychological clitoridectomy\non American girls.\nStarting in infancy,\nparents of baby boys are more likely\nto name all their body parts,\nat least they'll say,\n\"here's your pee-pee.\"\nParents of baby girls\ngo right from navel to knees,\nand they leave this whole\nsituation in here unnamed.\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nThere's no better way\nto make something unspeakable\nthan not to name it.\nThen kids go into\ntheir puberty education classes\nand they learn that boys\nhave erections and ejaculations,\nand girls have ...\nperiods and unwanted pregnancy.\nAnd they see that internal diagram\nof a woman's reproductive system —\nyou know, the one that looks\nkind of like a steer head —\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:33\n\n\nAnd it always grays out between the legs.\nSo we never say vulva,\nwe certainly never say clitoris.\nNo surprise,\nfewer than half\nof teenage girls age 14 to 17\nhave ever masturbated.\nAnd then they go\ninto their partnered experience\nand we expect that somehow\nthey'll think sex is about them,\nthat they'll be able to articulate\ntheir needs, their desires, their limits.\nIt's unrealistic.\n\n\n\n11:03\n\n\nHere's something, though.\nGirls' investment\nin their partner's pleasure remains\nregardless of the gender of the partner.\nSo in same-sex encounters,\nthe orgasm gap disappears.\nAnd young women climax\nat the same rate as men.\nLesbian and bisexual girls would tell me\nthat they felt liberated\nto get off the script —\nfree to create an encounter\nthat worked for them.\nGay girls also challenged\nthe idea of first intercourse\nas the definition of virginity.\nNot because intercourse isn't a big deal,\nbut it's worth questioning\nwhy we consider this one act,\nwhich most girls associate\nwith discomfort or pain,\nto be the line in the sand\nof sexual adulthood —\nso much more meaningful,\nso much more transformative\nthan anything else.\nAnd it's worth considering\nhow this is serving girls;\nwhether it's keeping them\nsafer from disease,\ncoercion, betrayal, assault.\nWhether it's encouraging\nmutuality and caring;\nwhat it means about the way\nthey see other sex acts;\nwhether it's giving them more control over\nand joy in their experience,\nand what it means about gay teens,\nwho can have multiple sex partners\nwithout heterosexual intercourse.\nSo I asked a gay girl that I met,\n\"How'd you know\nyou weren't a virgin anymore?\"\nShe said she had to Google it.\n\n\n\n12:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:34\n\n\nAnd Google wasn't sure.\n\n\n\n12:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:38\n\n\nShe finally decided\nthat she wasn't a virgin anymore\nafter she'd had\nher first orgasm with a partner.\nAnd I thought —\nwhoa.\nWhat if just for a second\nwe imagined that was the definition?\nAgain, not because\nintercourse isn't a big deal —\nof course it is —\nbut it isn't the only big deal,\nand rather than thinking about sex\nas a race to a goal,\nthis helps us reconceptualize it\nas a pool of experiences\nthat include warmth, affection, arousal,\ndesire, touch, intimacy.\nAnd it's worth asking young people:\nwho's really the more sexually\nexperienced person?\nThe one who makes out\nwith a partner for three hours\nand experiments with sensual\ntension and communication,\nor the one who gets wasted at a party\nand hooks up with a random\nin order to dump their \"virginity\"\nbefore they get to college?\n\n\n\n13:40\n\n\nThe only way that shift\nin thinking can happen though\nis if we talk to young people\nmore about sex —\nif we normalize those discussions,\nintegrating them into everyday life,\ntalking about those intimate acts\nin a different way —\nthe way we mostly have changed\nin the way that we talk\nabout women in the public realm.\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\nConsider a survey\nof 300 randomly chosen girls\nfrom a Dutch and an American university,\ntwo similar universities,\ntalking about their early\nexperience of sex.\nThe Dutch girls embodied everything\nwe say we want from our girls.\nThey had fewer negative consequences,\nlike disease, pregnancy, regret —\nmore positive outcomes\nlike being able to communicate\nwith their partner,\nwho they said they knew very well;\npreparing for the experience responsibly;\nenjoying themselves.\nWhat was their secret?\nThe Dutch girls said\nthat their doctors, teachers and parents\ntalked to them candidly,\nfrom an early age,\nabout sex, pleasure\nand the importance of mutual trust.\nWhat's more,\nwhile American parents weren't necessarily\nless comfortable talking about sex,\nwe tend to frame those conversations\nentirely in terms or risk and danger,\nwhereas Dutch parents talk\nabout balancing responsibility and joy.\nI have to tell you,\nas a parent myself,\nthat hit me hard,\nbecause I know,\nhad I not delved into that research,\nI would have talked to my own child\nabout contraception,\nabout disease protection,\nabout consent because I'm a modern parent,\nand I would have thought ...\njob well done.\n\n\n\n15:35\n\n\nNow I know that's not enough.\nI also know what I hope for for our girls.\nI want them to see sexuality\nas a source of self-knowledge,\ncreativity and communication,\ndespite its potential risks.\nI want them to be able\nto revel in their bodies' sensuality\nwithout being reduced to it.\nI want them to be able\nto ask for what they want in bed,\nand to get it.\nI want them to be safe\nfrom unwanted pregnancy,\ndisease,\ncruelty,\ndehumanization,\nviolence.\nIf they are assaulted,\nI want them to have recourse\nfrom their schools,\ntheir employers,\nthe courts.\nIt's a lot to ask,\nbut it's not too much.\n\n\n\n16:26\n\n\nAs parents, teachers,\nadvocates and activists,\nwe have raised a generation\nof girls to have a voice,\nto expect egalitarian\ntreatment in the home,\nin the classroom,\nin the workplace.\nNow it's time to demand\nthat intimate justice\nin their personal lives as well.\n\n\n\n16:50\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nOur lives depend\non a world we can't see.\nThink about your week so far.\nHave you watched TV, used GPS,\nchecked the weather or even ate a meal?\nThese many things\nthat enable our daily lives\nrely either directly or indirectly\non satellites.\nAnd while we often take for granted\nthe services that satellites provide us,\nthe satellites themselves\ndeserve our attention\nas they are leaving a lasting mark\non the space they occupy.\n\n\n\n 0:43\n\n\nPeople around the world\nrely on satellite infrastructure every day\nfor information, entertainment\nand to communicate.\nThere's agricultural\nand environmental monitoring,\nInternet connectivity, navigation.\nSatellites even play a role\nin the operation of our financial\nand energy markets.\nBut these satellites that we rely on\nday in and day out\nhave a finite life.\nThey might run out of propellant,\nthey could malfunction,\nor they may just naturally\nreach the end of their mission life.\nAt this point, these satellites\neffectively become space junk,\ncluttering the orbital environment.\n\n\n\n 1:22\n\n\nSo imagine you're driving down the highway\non a beautiful, sunny day\nout running errands.\nYou've got your music cranked,\nyour windows rolled down,\nwith the cool breeze\nblowing through your hair.\nFeels nice, right?\nEverything is going smoothly\nuntil suddenly\nyour car stutters and stalls\nright in the middle of the highway.\nSo now you have no choice\nbut to abandon your car\nwhere it is on the highway.\nMaybe you were lucky enough\nto be able to move it out of the way\nand into a shoulder lane\nso that it's out of the way\nof other traffic.\nA couple of hours ago,\nyour car was a useful machine\nthat you relied on in your everyday life.\nNow, it's a useless hunk of metal\ntaking up space in a valuable\ntransportation network.\nAnd imagine international roadways\nall cluttered with broken down vehicles\nthat are just getting in the way\nof other traffic.\nAnd imagine the debris\nthat would be strewn everywhere\nif a collision actually happened,\nthousands of smaller pieces of debris\nbecoming new obstacles.\n\n\n\n 2:26\n\n\nThis is the paradigm\nof the satellite industry.\nSatellites that are no longer working\nare often left to deorbit\nover many, many years,\nor only moved out of the way\nas a temporary solution.\nAnd there are no\ninternational laws in space\nto enforce us to clean up after ourselves.\n\n\n\n 2:45\n\n\nSo the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,\nwas launched in 1957,\nand in that year, there were\nonly a total of three launch attempts.\nDecades later and dozens of countries\nfrom all around the world\nhave launched thousands\nof more satellites into orbit,\nand the frequency of launches\nis only going to increase in the future,\nespecially if you consider\nthings like the possibility\nof 900-plus satellite\nconstellations being launched.\n\n\n\n 3:12\n\n\nNow, we send satellites\nto different orbits\ndepending on what they're needed for.\nOne of the most common places\nwe send satellites\nis the low Earth orbit,\npossibly to image the surface of Earth\nat up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.\nSatellites there are naturally buffeted\nby Earth's atmosphere,\nso their orbits naturally decay,\nand they'll eventually burn up,\nprobably within a couple of decades.\nAnother common place we send satellites\nis the geostationary orbit\nat about 35,000 kilometers altitude.\nSatellites there remain in the same place\nabove Earth as the Earth rotates,\nwhich enables things like communications\nor television broadcast, for example.\nSatellites in high orbits like these\ncould remain there for centuries.\nAnd then there's the orbit\ncoined \"the graveyard,\"\nthe ominous junk or disposal orbits,\nwhere some satellites\nare intentionally placed\nat the end of their life\nso that they're out of the way\nof common operational orbits.\n\n\n\n 4:11\n\n\nOf the nearly 7,000 satellites\nlaunched since the late 1950s,\nonly about one in seven\nis currently operational,\nand in addition to the satellites\nthat are no longer working,\nthere's also hundreds of thousands\nof marble-sized debris\nand millions of paint chip-sized debris\nthat are also orbiting around the Earth.\nSpace debris is a major risk\nto space missions,\nbut also to the satellites\nthat we rely on each and every day.\n\n\n\n 4:39\n\n\nNow, because space debris and junk\nhas become increasingly worrisome,\nthere have been some national\nand international efforts\nto develop technical standards\nto help us limit the generation\nof additional debris.\nSo for example, there are recommendations\nfor those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft\nto be made to deorbit in under 25 years,\nbut that's still a really long time,\nespecially if a satellite\nhasn't been working for years.\nThere's also mandates\nfor those dead geostationary spacecraft\nto be moved into a graveyard orbit.\nBut neither of these guidelines\nis binding under international law,\nand the understanding is that they will be\nimplemented through national mechanisms.\nThese guidelines are also not long-term,\nthey're not proactive,\nnor do they address\nthe debris that's already up there.\nThey're only in place\nto limit the future creation of debris.\nSpace junk is no one's responsibility.\n\n\n\n 5:34\n\n\nNow, Mount Everest is actually\nan interesting comparison\nof a new approach to how\nwe interact with our environments,\nas it's often given the dubious honor\nof being the world's highest garbage dump.\nDecades after the first conquest\nof the world's highest peak,\ntons of rubbish left behind by climbers\nhas started to raise concern,\nand you may have read in the news\nthat there's speculation\nthat Nepal will crack down on mountaineers\nwith stricter enforcement\nof penalties and legal obligations.\nThe goal, of course,\nis to persuade climbers\nto clean up after themselves,\nso maybe local not-for-profits will pay\nclimbers who bring down extra waste,\nor expeditions might organize\nvoluntary cleanup trips.\nAnd yet still many climbers feel\nthat independent groups\nshould police themselves.\nThere's no simple or easy answer,\nand even well-intentioned\nefforts at conservation\noften run into problems.\nBut that doesn't mean\nwe shouldn't do everything in our power\nto protect the environments\nthat we rely and depend on,\nand like Everest, the remote location\nand inadequate infrastructure\nof the orbital environment\nmake waste disposal a challenging problem.\nBut we simply cannot reach new heights\nand create an even higher garbage dump,\none that's out of this world.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nThe reality of space\nis that if a component\non a satellite breaks down,\nthere really are limited\nopportunities for repairs,\nand only at great cost.\nBut what if we were smarter\nabout how we designed satellites?\nWhat if all satellites,\nregardless of what country\nthey were built in,\nhad to be standardized in some way\nfor recycling, servicing\nor active deorbiting?\nWhat if there actually were\ninternational laws with teeth\nthat enforced end-of-life\ndisposal of satellites\ninstead of moving them out of the way\nas a temporary solution?\nOr maybe satellite manufacturers\nneed to be charged a deposit\nto even launch a satellite into orbit,\nand that deposit would only be returned\nif the satellite was disposed of properly\nor if they cleaned up\nsome quota of debris.\nOr maybe a satellite\nneeds to have technology on board\nto help accelerate deorbit.\n\n\n\n 7:49\n\n\nThere are some encouraging signs.\nThe UK's TechDemoSat-1,\nlaunched in 2014, for example,\nwas designed for end-of-life disposal\nvia a small drag sail.\nThis works for the satellite\nbecause it's small,\nbut satellites that are higher\nor in larger orbits\nor are larger altogether,\nlike the size of school buses,\nwill require other disposal options.\nSo maybe you get into things\nlike high-powered lasers\nor tugging using nets or tethers,\nas crazy as those sound in the short term.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nAnd then one really cool possibility\nis the idea of orbital tow trucks\nor space mechanics.\nImagine if a robotic arm\non some sort of space tow truck\ncould fix the broken components\non a satellite,\nmaking them usable again.\nOr what if that very same robotic arm\ncould refuel the propellant tank\non a spacecraft\nthat relies on chemical propulsion\njust like you or I would refuel\nthe fuel tanks on our cars?\nRobotic repair and maintenance\ncould extend the lives of hundreds\nof satellites orbiting around the Earth.\n\n\n\n 8:51\n\n\nWhatever the disposal\nor cleanup options we come up with,\nit's clearly not just a technical problem.\nThere's also complex space laws\nand politics that we have to sort out.\nSimply put, we haven't found a way\nto use space sustainably yet.\n\n\n\n 9:07\n\n\nExploring, innovating\nto change the way we live and work\nare what we as humans do,\nand in space exploration,\nwe're literally moving\nbeyond the boundaries of Earth.\nBut as we push thresholds\nin the name of learning and innovation,\nwe must remember that accountability\nfor our environments never goes away.\nThere is without doubt congestion\nin the low Earth and geostationary orbits,\nand we cannot keep\nlaunching new satellites\nto replace the ones that have broken down\nwithout doing something about them first,\njust like we would never\nleave a broken down car\nin the middle of the highway.\nNext time you use your phone,\ncheck the weather or use your GPS,\nthink about the satellite technologies\nthat make those activities possible.\nBut also think about the very impact\nthat the satellites have\non the environment surrounding Earth,\nand help spread the message\nthat together we must reduce our impact.\n\n\n\n10:01\n\n\nEarth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful\nand our gateway to exploration.\nIt's up to us to keep it that way.\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n10:11\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nOne summer afternoon in 2013,\nDC police detained, questioned\nand searched a man\nwho appeared suspicious\nand potentially dangerous.\nThis wasn't what I was wearing\nthe day of the detention, to be fair,\nbut I have a picture of that as well.\nI know it's very frightening —\ntry to remain calm.\n\n\n\n 0:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:30\n\n\nAt this time, I was interning\nat the Public Defender Service\nin Washington DC,\nand I was visiting\na police station for work.\nI was on my way out,\nand before I could make it to my car,\ntwo police cars pulled up\nto block my exit,\nand an officer approached me from behind.\nHe told me to stop, take my backpack off\nand put my hands on the police car\nparked next to us.\nAbout a dozen officers\nthen gathered near us.\nAll of them had handguns,\nsome had assault rifles.\nThey rifled through my backpack.\nThey patted me down.\nThey took pictures of me\nspread on the police car,\nand they laughed.\n\n\n\n 1:04\n\n\nAnd as all this was happening —\nas I was on the police car trying\nto ignore the shaking in my legs,\ntrying to think clearly\nabout what I should do —\nsomething stuck out to me as odd.\nWhen I look at myself in this photo,\nif I were to describe myself,\nI think I'd say something like,\n\"19-year-old Indian male,\nbright T-shirt, wearing glasses.\"\nBut they weren't including\nany of these details.\nInto their police radios\nas they described me,\nthey kept saying, \"Middle Eastern\nmale with a backpack.\nMiddle Eastern male with a backpack.\"\nAnd this description carried on\ninto their police reports.\nI never expected to be described\nby my own government in these terms:\n\"lurking,\"\n\"nefarious,\"\n\"terrorist.\"\nAnd the detention dragged on like this.\n\n\n\n 1:49\n\n\nThey sent dogs trained to smell explosives\nto sweep the area I'd been in.\nThey called the federal government\nto see if I was on any watch lists.\nThey sent a couple of detectives\nto cross-examine me on why,\nif I claimed I had nothing to hide,\nI wouldn't consent to a search of my car.\nAnd I could see\nthey weren't happy with me,\nbut I felt I had no way of knowing\nwhat they'd want to do next.\nAt one point, the officer\nwho patted me down\nscanned the side of the police station\nto see where the security camera was\nto see how much of this\nwas being recorded.\nAnd when he did that,\nit really sank in how completely\nI was at their mercy.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nI think we're all normalized\nfrom a young age\nto the idea of police officers\nand arrests and handcuffs,\nso it's easy to forget how demeaning\nand coercive a thing it is\nto seize control over\nanother person's body.\nI know it sounds like\nthe point of my story\nis how badly treated I was\nbecause of my race —\nand yes, I don't think I would've been\ndetained if I were white.\nBut actually, what I have in mind\ntoday is something else.\nWhat I have in mind is how\nmuch worse things might've been\nif I weren't affluent.\nI mean, they thought I might be trying\nto plant an explosive,\nand they investigated that possibility\nfor an hour and a half,\nbut I was never put in handcuffs,\nI was never taken to a jail cell.\nI think if I were from one of Washington\nDC's poor communities of color,\nand they thought I was\nendangering officers' lives,\nthings might've ended differently.\nAnd in fact, in our system, I think\nit's better to be an affluent person\nsuspected of trying\nto blow up a police station\nthan it is to be a poor person\nwho's suspected of much,\nmuch less than this.\n\n\n\n 3:19\n\n\nI want to give you an example\nfrom my current work.\nRight now, I'm working\nat a civil rights organization in DC,\ncalled Equal Justice Under Law.\nLet me start by asking you all a question.\nHow many of you have ever gotten\na parking ticket in your life?\nRaise your hand.\nYeah. So have I.\nAnd when I had to pay it,\nit felt annoying and it felt bad,\nbut I paid it and I moved on.\nI'm guessing most of you\nhave paid your tickets as well.\nBut what would happen if you\ncouldn't afford the amount on the ticket\nand your family doesn't have\nthe money either, what happens then?\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nWell, one thing that's not supposed\nto happen under the law is,\nyou're not supposed to be\narrested and jailed\nsimply because you can't afford to pay.\nThat's illegal under federal law.\nBut that's what local governments\nacross the country are doing\nto people who are poor.\nAnd so many of our lawsuits\nat Equal Justice Under Law\ntarget these modern-day debtors' prisons.\n\n\n\n 4:12\n\n\nOne of our cases is against\nFerguson, Missouri.\nAnd I know when I say Ferguson,\nmany of you will think of police violence.\nBut today I want to talk\nabout a different aspect\nof the relationship between\ntheir police force and their citizens.\nFerguson was issuing an average\nof over two arrest warrants,\nper person, per year,\nmostly for unpaid debt to the courts.\nWhen I imagine what that would feel like\nif, every time I left my house,\nthere was a chance a police officer\nwould run my license plate,\nsee a warrant for unpaid debt,\nseize my body they way the did in DC\nand then take me to a jail cell,\nI feel a little sick.\n\n\n\n 4:49\n\n\nI've met many of the people in Ferguson\nwho have experienced this,\nand I've heard some of their stories.\nIn Ferguson's jail,\nin each small cell,\nthere's a bunk bed and a toilet,\nbut they'd pack four people\ninto each cell.\nSo there'd be two people on the bunks\nand two people on the floor,\none with nowhere to go except\nright next to the filthy toilet,\nwhich was never cleaned.\nIn fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,\nso the floor and the walls were lined\nwith blood and mucus.\nNo water to drink,\nexcept coming out of a spigot\nconnected to the toilet.\nThe water looked and tasted dirty,\nthere was never enough food,\nnever any showers,\nwomen menstruating\nwithout any hygiene products,\nno medical attention whatsoever.\nWhen I asked a woman\nabout medical attention,\nshe laughed, and she said, \"Oh, no, no.\nThe only attention you get\nfrom the guards in there is sexual.\"\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\nSo, they'd take the debtors\nto this place and they'd say,\n\"We're not letting you leave\nuntil you make a payment on your debt.\"\nAnd if you could — if you\ncould call a family member\nwho could somehow come up with some money,\nthen maybe you were out.\nIf it was enough money, you were out.\nBut if it wasn't, you'd stay there\nfor days or weeks,\nand every day the guards\nwould come down to the cells\nand haggle with the debtors\nabout the price of release that day.\nYou'd stay until, at some point,\nthe jail would be booked to capacity,\nand they'd want to book someone new in.\nAnd at that point, they'd think,\n\"OK, it's unlikely this person\ncan come up with the money,\nit's more likely this new person will.\"\nYou're out, they're in,\nand the machine kept moving like that.\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\nI met a man who,\nnine years ago, was arrested\nfor panhandling in a Walgreens.\nHe couldn't afford his fines\nand his court fees from that case.\nWhen he was young\nhe survived a house fire,\nonly because he jumped out\nof the third-story window to escape.\nBut that fall left him\nwith damage to his brain\nand several parts of this body,\nincluding his leg.\nSo he can't work,\nand he relies on social security\npayments to survive.\nWhen I met him in his apartment,\nhe had nothing of value there —\nnot even food in his fridge.\nHe's chronically hungry.\nHe had nothing of value in his apartment\nexcept a small piece of cardboard\non which he'd written\nthe names of his children.\nHe cherished this a lot.\nHe was happy to show it to me.\nBut he can't pay his fines and fees\nbecause he has nothing to give.\nIn the last nine years,\nhe's been arrested 13 times,\nand jailed for a total of 130 days\non that panhandling case.\nOne of those stretches lasted 45 days.\nJust imagine spending from right now\nuntil sometime in June\nin the place that I described to you\na few moments ago.\n\n\n\n 7:19\n\n\nHe told me about all the suicide attempts\nhe's seen in Ferguson's jail;\nabout the time a man found\na way to hang himself\nout of reach of the other inmates,\nso all they could do\nwas yell and yell and yell,\ntrying to get the guards' attention\nso they could come down and cut him down.\nAnd he told me that it took the guards\nover five minutes to respond,\nand when they came,\nthe man was unconscious.\nSo they called the paramedics\nand the paramedics went to the cell.\nThey said, \"He'll be OK,\"\nso they just left him there on the floor.\nI heard many stories like this\nand they shouldn't have surprised me,\nbecause suicide is the single leading\ncause of death in our local jails.\nThis is related to the lack\nof mental health care in our jails.\n\n\n\n 7:57\n\n\nI met a woman, single mother of three,\nmaking seven dollars an hour.\nShe relies on food stamps\nto feed herself and her children.\nAbout a decade ago,\nshe got a couple of traffic tickets\nand a minor theft charge,\nand she can't afford her fines\nand fees on those cases.\nSince then, she's been jailed\nabout 10 times on those cases,\nbut she has schizophrenia\nand bipolar disorder,\nand she needs medication every day.\nShe doesn't have access\nto those medications in Ferguson's jail,\nbecause no one has access\nto their medications.\nShe told me about what it was like\nto spend two weeks in a cage,\nhallucinating people and shadows\nand hearing voices,\nbegging for the medication\nthat would make it all stop,\nonly to be ignored.\nAnd this isn't anomalous, either:\nthirty percent of women in our local jails\nhave serious mental health needs\njust like hers,\nbut only one in six receives\nany mental health care while in jail.\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\nAnd so, I heard all these stories\nabout this grotesque dungeon\nthat Ferguson was operating\nfor its debtors,\nand when it came time\nfor me to actually see it\nand to go visit Ferguson's jail,\nI'm not sure what I was expecting to see,\nbut I wasn't expecting this.\nIt's an ordinary government building.\nIt could be a post office or a school.\nIt reminded me that these illegal\nextortion schemes\naren't being run somewhere in the shadows,\nthey're being run out in the open\nby our public officials.\nThey're a matter of public policy.\nAnd this reminded me\nthat poverty jailing in general,\neven outside the debtors' prison context,\nplays a very visible and central role\nin our justice system.\n\n\n\n 9:28\n\n\nWhat I have in mind is our policy of bail.\nIn our system, whether\nyou're detained or free,\npending trial is not a matter\nof how dangerous you are\nor how much of a flight risk you pose.\nIt's a matter of whether you can afford\nto post your bail amount.\nSo Bill Cosby, whose bail\nwas set at a million dollars,\nimmediately writes the check,\nand doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.\nBut Sandra Bland, who died in jail,\nwas only there because her family\nwas unable to come up with 500 dollars.\nIn fact, there are half a million\nSandra Blands across the country —\n500,000 people who are in jail right now,\nonly because they can't afford\ntheir bail amount.\n\n\n\n10:02\n\n\nWe're told that our jails\nare places for criminals,\nbut statistically that's not the case:\nthree out of every five people\nin jail right now are there pretrial.\nThey haven't been convicted of any crime;\nthey haven't pled guilty to any offense.\nRight here in San Francisco,\n85 percent of the inmates\nin our jail in San Francisco\nare pretrial detainees.\nThis means San Francisco is spending\nsomething like 80 million dollars\nevery year\nto fund pretrial detention.\n\n\n\n10:32\n\n\nMany of these people who are in jail\nonly because they can't post bail\nare facing allegations so minor\nthat the amount of time it would take\nfor them to sit waiting for trial\nis longer than the sentence\nthey would receive if convicted,\nwhich means they're guaranteed\nto get out faster\nif they just plead guilty.\nSo now the choice is:\nShould I stay here in this horrible place,\naway from my family and my dependents,\nalmost guaranteed to lose my job,\nand then fight the charges?\nOr should I just plead guilty to whatever\nthe prosecutor wants and get out?\nAnd at this point, they're pretrial\ndetainees, not criminals.\nBut once they take that plea deal,\nwe'll call them criminals,\neven though an affluent person\nwould never have been in this situation,\nbecause an affluent person\nwould have simply been bailed out.\n\n\n\n11:15\n\n\nAt this point you might be wondering,\n\"This guy's in the inspiration section,\nwhat is he doing —\n\n\n\n11:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:21\n\n\n\"This is extremely depressing.\nI want my money back.\"\n\n\n\n11:24\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:25\n\n\nBut in actuality,\nI find talking about jailing much less\ndepressing than the alternative,\nbecause I think if we don't talk\nabout these issues\nand collectively change\nhow we think about jailing,\nat the end of all of our lives,\nwe'll still have jails full of poor people\nwho don't belong there.\nThat really is depressing to me.\nBut what's exciting to me is the thought\nthat these stories can move us\nto think about jailing in different terms.\nNot in sterile policy terms\nlike \"mass incarceration,\"\nor \"sentencing of nonviolent offenders,\"\nbut in human terms.\n\n\n\n11:55\n\n\nWhen we put a human being in a cage\nfor days or weeks or months\nor even years,\nwhat are we doing\nto that person's mind and body?\nUnder what conditions\nare we really willing to do that?\nAnd so if starting with a few\nhundred of us in this room,\nwe can commit to thinking about\njailing in this different light,\nthen we can undo that normalization\nI was referring to earlier.\n\n\n\n12:16\n\n\nIf I leave you with anything today,\nI hope it's with the thought\nthat if we want anything\nto fundamentally change —\nnot just to reform our policies\non bail and fines and fees —\nbut also to make sure that whatever\nnew policies replace those\ndon't punish the poor and the marginalized\nin their own new way.\nIf we want that kind of change,\nthen this shift in thinking\nis required of each of us.\n\n\n\n12:36\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:37\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nThis is a tuberculosis ward,\nand at the time this picture was taken\nin the late 1800s,\none in seven of all people\ndied from tuberculosis.\nWe had no idea\nwhat was causing this disease.\nThe hypothesis was actually\nit was your constitution\nthat made you susceptible.\nAnd it was a highly romanticized disease.\nIt was also called consumption,\nand it was the disorder of poets\nand artists and intellectuals.\nAnd some people actually thought\nit gave you heightened sensitivity\nand conferred creative genius.\n\n\n\n 0:51\n\n\nBy the 1950s,\nwe instead knew\nthat tuberculosis was caused\nby a highly contagious\nbacterial infection,\nwhich is slightly less romantic,\nbut that had the upside\nof us being able to maybe\ndevelop drugs to treat it.\nSo doctors had discovered\na new drug, iproniazid,\nthat they were optimistic\nmight cure tuberculosis,\nand they gave it to patients,\nand patients were elated.\nThey were more social, more energetic.\nOne medical report actually says\nthey were \"dancing in the halls.\"\nAnd unfortunately,\nthis was not necessarily\nbecause they were getting better.\nA lot of them were still dying.\nAnother medical report describes them\nas being \"inappropriately happy.\"\nAnd that is how the first\nantidepressant was discovered.\n\n\n\n 1:46\n\n\nSo accidental discovery\nis not uncommon in science,\nbut it requires more\nthan just a happy accident.\nYou have to be able to recognize it\nfor discovery to occur.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nAs a neuroscientist,\nI'm going to talk to you a little bit\nabout my firsthand experience\nwith whatever you want to call\nthe opposite of dumb luck —\nlet's call it smart luck.\nBut first, a bit more background.\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\nThankfully, since the 1950s,\nwe've developed some other drugs\nand we can actually now cure tuberculosis.\nAnd at least in the United States,\nthough not necessarily in other countries,\nwe have closed our sanitoriums\nand probably most of you\nare not too worried about TB.\nBut a lot of what was true\nin the early 1900s\nabout infectious disease,\nwe can say now\nabout psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nWe are in the middle\nof an epidemic of mood disorders\nlike depression and post-traumatic\nstress disorder, or PTSD.\nOne in four of all adults\nin the United States\nsuffers from mental illness,\nwhich means that if you haven't\nexperienced it personally\nor someone in your family hasn't,\nit's still very likely\nthat someone you know has,\nthough they may not talk about it.\nDepression has actually now surpassed\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war\nas the leading cause\nof disability worldwide.\nAnd also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,\nwe don't know what causes it.\nOnce it's developed, it's chronic,\nlasts a lifetime,\nand there are no known cures.\n\n\n\n 3:25\n\n\nThe second antidepressant we discovered,\nalso by accident, in the 1950s,\nfrom an antihistamine\nthat was making people manic,\nimipramine.\nAnd in both the case of the tuberculosis\nward and the antihistamine,\nsomeone had to be able to recognize\nthat a drug that was designed\nto do one thing —\ntreat tuberculosis\nor suppress allergies —\ncould be used to do\nsomething very different —\ntreat depression.\nAnd this sort of repurposing\nis actually quite challenging.\nWhen doctors first saw\nthis mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,\nthey didn't really recognize\nwhat they saw.\nThey were so used to thinking about it\nfrom the framework\nof being a tuberculosis drug\nthat they actually just listed it\nas a side effect, an adverse side effect.\n\n\n\n 4:11\n\n\nAs you can see here,\na lot of these patients in 1954\nare experiencing severe euphoria.\nAnd they were worried\nthat this might somehow interfere\nwith their recovering from tuberculosis.\nSo they recommended that iproniazid\nonly be used in cases of extreme TB\nand in patients that were\nhighly emotionally stable,\nwhich is of course the exact opposite\nof how we use it as an antidepressant.\nThey were so used to looking at it\nfrom the perspective of this one disease,\nthey could not see the larger implications\nfor another disease.\n\n\n\n 4:48\n\n\nAnd to be fair,\nit's not entirely their fault.\nFunctional fixedness\nis a bias that affects all of us.\nIt's a tendency to only\nbe able to think of an object\nin terms of its traditional\nuse or function.\nAnd mental set is another thing. Right?\nThat's sort of this preconceived framework\nwith which we approach problems.\nAnd that actually makes repurposing\npretty hard for all of us,\nwhich is, I guess, why they gave\na TV show to the guy who was,\nlike, really great at repurposing.\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:18\n\n\nSo the effects in both the case\nof iproniazid and imipramine,\nthey were so strong —\nthere was mania,\nor people dancing in the halls.\nIt's actually not that surprising\nthey were caught.\nBut it does make you wonder\nwhat else we've missed.\nSo iproniazid and imipramine,\nthey're more than just\na case study in repurposing.\nThey have two other things in common\nthat are really important.\nOne, they have terrible side effects.\nThat includes liver toxicity,\nweight gain of over 50 pounds,\nsuicidality.\nAnd two, they both\nincrease levels of serotonin,\nwhich is a chemical signal in the brain,\nor a neurotransmitter.\nAnd those two things together,\nright, one or the two,\nmay not have been that important,\nbut the two together meant\nthat we had to develop safer drugs,\nand that serotonin seemed\nlike a pretty good place to start.\n\n\n\n 6:12\n\n\nSo we developed drugs\nto more specifically focus on serotonin,\nthe selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,\nthe most famous of which is Prozac.\nAnd that was 30 years ago,\nand since then we have mostly\njust worked on optimizing those drugs.\nAnd the SSRIs, they are better\nthan the drugs that came before them,\nbut they still have a lot of side effects,\nincluding weight gain, insomnia,\nsuicidality —\nand they take a really long time to work,\nsomething like four to six weeks\nin a lot of patients.\nAnd that's in the patients\nwhere they do work.\nThere are a lot of patients\nwhere these drugs don't work.\n\n\n\n 6:49\n\n\nAnd that means now, in 2016,\nwe still have no cures\nfor any mood disorders,\njust drugs that suppress symptoms,\nwhich is kind of the difference between\ntaking a painkiller for an infection\nversus an antibiotic.\nA painkiller will make you feel better,\nbut is not going to do anything\nto treat that underlying disease.\nAnd it was this flexibility\nin our thinking\nthat let us recognize\nthat iproniazid and imipramine\ncould be repurposed in this way,\nwhich led us to the serotonin hypothesis,\nwhich we then, ironically, fixated on.\nThis is brain signaling, serotonin,\nfrom an SSRI commercial.\nIn case you're not clear,\nthis is a dramatization.\nAnd in science, we try\nand remove our bias, right,\nby running double-blinded experiments\nor being statistically agnostic\nas to what our results will be.\nBut bias creeps in more insidiously\nin what we choose to study\nand how we choose to study it.\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nSo we've focused on serotonin now\nfor the past 30 years,\noften to the exclusion of other things.\nWe still have no cures,\nand what if serotonin\nisn't all there is to depression?\nWhat if it's not even the key part of it?\nThat means no matter how much time\nor money or effort we put into it,\nit will never lead to a cure.\n\n\n\n 8:09\n\n\nIn the past few years,\ndoctors have discovered\nprobably what is the first truly new\nantidepressant since the SSRIs,\nCalypsol,\nand this drug works very quickly,\nwithin a few hours or a day,\nand it doesn't work on serotonin.\nIt works on glutamate,\nwhich is another neurotransmitter.\nAnd it's also repurposed.\nIt was traditionally used\nas anesthesia in surgery.\nBut unlike those other drugs,\nwhich were recognized pretty quickly,\nit took us 20 years\nto realize that Calypsol\nwas an antidepressant,\ndespite the fact that it's actually\na better antidepressant,\nprobably, than those other drugs.\nIt's actually probably because of the fact\nthat it's a better antidepressant\nthat it was harder for us to recognize.\nThere was no mania to signal its effects.\n\n\n\n 8:53\n\n\nSo in 2013, up at Columbia University,\nI was working with my colleague,\nDr. Christine Ann Denny,\nand we were studying Calypsol\nas an antidepressant in mice.\nAnd Calypsol has, like,\na really short half-life,\nwhich means it's out of your body\nwithin a few hours.\nAnd we were just piloting.\nSo we would give an injection to mice,\nand then we'd wait a week,\nand then we'd run\nanother experiment to save money.\n\n\n\n 9:19\n\n\nAnd one of the experiments I was running,\nwe would stress the mice,\nand we used that as a model of depression.\nAnd at first it kind of just looked\nlike it didn't really work at all.\nSo we could have stopped there.\nBut I have run this model\nof depression for years,\nand the data just looked kind of weird.\nIt didn't really look right to me.\nSo I went back,\nand we reanalyzed it\nbased on whether or not they had gotten\nthat one injection of Calypsol\na week beforehand.\nAnd it looked kind of like this.\nSo if you look at the far left,\nif you put a mouse in a new space,\nthis is the box, it's very exciting,\na mouse will walk around and explore,\nand you can see that pink line\nis actually the measure of them walking.\nAnd we also give it\nanother mouse in a pencil cup\nthat it can decide to interact with.\nThis is also a dramatization,\nin case that's not clear.\nAnd a normal mouse will explore.\nIt will be social.\nCheck out what's going on.\nIf you stress a mouse\nin this depression model,\nwhich is the middle box,\nthey aren't social, they don't explore.\nThey mostly just kind of hide\nin that back corner, behind a cup.\nYet the mice that had gotten\nthat one injection of Calypsol,\nhere on your right,\nthey were exploring, they were social.\nThey looked like they\nhad never been stressed at all,\nwhich is impossible.\n\n\n\n10:41\n\n\nSo we could have just stopped there,\nbut Christine had also used\nCalypsol before as anesthesia,\nand a few years ago she had seen\nthat it seemed to have\nsome weird effects on cells\nand some other behavior\nthat also seemed to last\nlong after the drug,\nmaybe a few weeks.\nSo we were like, OK,\nmaybe this is not completely impossible,\nbut we were really skeptical.\n\n\n\n11:02\n\n\nSo we did what you do in science\nwhen you're not sure,\nand we ran it again.\nAnd I remember being in the animal room,\nmoving mice from box to box\nto test them,\nand Christine was actually sitting\non the floor with the computer in her lap\nso the mice couldn't see her,\nand she was analyzing\nthe data in real time.\nAnd I remember us yelling,\nwhich you're not supposed to do\nin an animal room where you're testing,\nbecause it had worked.\nIt seemed like these mice\nwere protected against stress,\nor they were inappropriately happy,\nhowever you want to call it.\nAnd we were really excited.\n\n\n\n11:38\n\n\nAnd then we were really skeptical,\nbecause it was too good to be true.\nSo we ran it again.\nAnd then we ran it again in a PTSD model,\nand we ran it again\nin a physiological model,\nwhere all we did was give stress hormones.\nAnd we had our undergrads run it.\nAnd then we had our collaborators\nhalfway across the world in France run it.\nAnd every time someone ran it,\nthey confirmed the same thing.\nIt seemed like\nthis one injection of Calypsol\nwas somehow protecting\nagainst stress for weeks.\n\n\n\n12:08\n\n\nAnd we only published this a year ago,\nbut since then other labs\nhave independently confirmed this effect.\nSo we don't know what causes depression,\nbut we do know that stress\nis the initial trigger\nin 80 percent of cases,\nand depression and PTSD\nare different diseases,\nbut this is something\nthey share in common.\nRight? It is traumatic stress\nlike active combat or natural disasters\nor community violence or sexual assault\nthat causes post-traumatic\nstress disorder,\nand not everyone that is exposed to stress\ndevelops a mood disorder.\nAnd this ability to experience\nstress and be resilient\nand bounce back and not develop\ndepression or PTSD\nis known as stress resilience,\nand it varies between people.\nAnd we have always thought of it\nas just sort of this passive property.\nIt's the absence of susceptibility factors\nand risk factors for these disorders.\nBut what if it were active?\nMaybe we could enhance it,\nsort of akin to putting on armor.\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\nWe had accidentally discovered\nthe first resilience-enhancing drug.\nAnd like I said, we only gave\na tiny amount of the drug,\nand it lasted for weeks,\nand that's not like anything\nyou see with antidepressants.\n\n\n\n13:25\n\n\nBut it is actually kind of similar\nto what you see in immune vaccines.\nSo in immune vaccines,\nyou'll get your shots,\nand then weeks, months, years later,\nwhen you're actually exposed to bacteria,\nit's not the vaccine in your body\nthat protects you.\nIt's your own immune system\nthat's developed resistance and resilience\nto this bacteria that fights it off,\nand you actually never get the infection,\nwhich is very different\nfrom, say, our treatments. Right?\nIn that case, you get the infection,\nyou're exposed to the bacteria,\nyou're sick, and then you take,\nsay, an antibiotic which cures it,\nand those drugs are actually working\nto kill the bacteria.\nOr similar to as I said before,\nwith this palliative,\nyou'll take something\nthat will suppress the symptoms,\nbut it won't treat\nthe underlying infection,\nand you'll only feel better\nduring the time in which you're taking it,\nwhich is why you have to keep taking it.\nAnd in depression and PTSD —\nhere we have your stress exposure —\nwe only have palliative care.\nAntidepressants only suppress symptoms,\nand that is why you basically\nhave to keep taking them\nfor the life of the disease,\nwhich is often\nthe length of your own life.\n\n\n\n14:34\n\n\nSo we're calling our resilience-enhancing\ndrugs \"paravaccines,\"\nwhich means vaccine-like,\nbecause it seems\nlike they might have the potential\nto protect against stress\nand prevent mice from developing\ndepression and post-traumatic\nstress disorder.\nAlso, not all antidepressants\nare also paravaccines.\nWe tried Prozac as well,\nand that had no effect.\n\n\n\n15:00\n\n\nSo if this were to translate into humans,\nwe might be able to protect people\nwho are predictably at risk\nagainst stress-induced disorders\nlike depression and PTSD.\nSo that's first responders\nand firefighters,\nrefugees, prisoners and prison guards,\nsoldiers, you name it.\n\n\n\n15:22\n\n\nAnd to give you a sense\nof the scale of these diseases,\nin 2010, the global burden of disease\nwas estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,\nand since they are chronic,\nthat cost is compounding\nand is therefore expected to rise\nup to six trillion dollars\nin just the next 15 years.\n\n\n\n15:43\n\n\nAs I mentioned before,\nrepurposing can be challenging\nbecause of our prior biases.\nCalypsol has another name,\nketamine,\nwhich also goes by another name,\nSpecial K,\nwhich is a club drug and drug of abuse.\nIt's still used across the world\nas an anesthetic.\nIt's used in children.\nWe use it on the battlefield.\nIt's actually the drug of choice\nin a lot of developing nations,\nbecause it doesn't affect breathing.\nIt is on the World Health Organization\nlist of most essential medicines.\n\n\n\n16:17\n\n\nIf we had discovered ketamine\nas a paravaccine first,\nit'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,\nbut as is, we have to compete\nwith our functional fixedness\nand mental set that kind of interfere.\nFortunately, it's not\nthe only compound we have discovered\nthat has these prophylactic,\nparavaccine qualities,\nbut all of the other drugs\nwe've discovered,\nor compounds if you will,\nthey're totally new,\nthey have to go through\nthe entire FDA approval process —\nif they make it before\nthey can ever be used in humans.\nAnd that will be years.\nSo if we wanted something sooner,\nketamine is already FDA-approved.\nIt's generic, it's available.\nWe could develop it for a fraction\nof the price and a fraction of the time.\n\n\n\n17:07\n\n\nBut actually, beyond\nfunctional fixedness and mental set,\nthere's a real other challenge\nto repurposing drugs,\nwhich is policy.\nThere are no incentives in place\nonce a drug is generic and off patent\nand no longer exclusive\nto encourage pharma companies\nto develop them,\nbecause they don't make money.\nAnd that's not true for just ketamine.\nThat is true for all drugs.\nRegardless, the idea itself\nis completely novel in psychiatry,\nto use drugs to prevent mental illness\nas opposed to just treat it.\n\n\n\n17:43\n\n\nIt is possible that 20, 50,\n100 years from now,\nwe will look back now\nat depression and PTSD\nthe way we look back\nat tuberculosis sanitoriums\nas a thing of the past.\nThis could be the beginning of the end\nof the mental health epidemic.\n\n\n\n18:04\n\n\nBut as a great scientist once said,\n\"Only a fool is sure of anything.\nA wise man keeps on guessing.\"\n\n\n\n18:15\n\n\nThank you, guys.\n\n\n\n18:16\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI have a two-year-old daughter named Naya\nwho is under the mistaken impression\nthat this conference\nis named in honor of her father.\n\n\n\n 0:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:21\n\n\nWho am I to contradict my baby girl?\n\n\n\n 0:24\n\n\nAs many of you know, there's something\nabout becoming a parent\nthat concentrates the mind\non long-term problems like climate change.\nIt was the birth of my daughter\nthat inspired me\nto launch this climate organization,\nin order to counteract the excessive\npolarization of this issue\nin the United States,\nand to find a conservative\npathway forward.\nYes, folks, a Republican\nclimate solution is possible,\nand you know what?\nIt may even be better.\n\n\n\n 0:57\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:59\n\n\nLet me try to prove that to you.\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nWhat we really need\nis a killer app to climate policy.\nIn the technology world, a killer app\nis an application so transformative\nthat it creates its own market,\nlike Uber.\nIn the climate world,\na killer app is a new\nsolution so promising\nthat it can break through\nthe seemingly insurmountable\nbarriers to progress.\nThese include the psychological barrier.\nClimate advocates have long\nbeen encouraging their fellow citizens\nto make short-term sacrifices now\nfor benefits that accrue to other people\nin other countries 30 or 40\nyears in the future.\nIt just doesn't fly because it runs\ncontrary to basic human nature.\n\n\n\n 1:45\n\n\nNext is the geopolitical barrier.\nUnder the current rules of global trade,\ncountries have a strong incentive\nto free ride off the emissions reductions\nof other nations,\ninstead of strengthening\ntheir own programs.\nThis has been the curse\nof every international\nclimate negotiations, including Paris.\nFinally, we have the partisan barrier.\nEven the most committed countries —\nGermany, the United Kingdom, Canada —\nare nowhere near reducing emissions\nat the required scale and speed.\nNot even close.\nAnd the partisan climate divide\nis far more acute\nhere in the United States.\nWe are fundamentally stuck,\nand that is why we need\na killer app of climate policy\nto break through each of these barriers.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nI'm convinced that the road\nto climate progress in the United States\nruns through the Republican Party\nand the business community.\nSo in launching\nthe Climate Leadership Council,\nI started by reaching out to a who's who\nof Republican elder statesmen\nand business leaders,\nincluding James Baker and George Schultz,\nthe two most respected Republican\nelder statesmen in America;\nMartin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,\nthe two most respected\nconservative economists in the country;\nand Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,\ntwo of the most successful\nand admired business leaders.\nTogether, we co-authored\n\"The Conservative Case\nFor Carbon Dividends.\"\nThis represents the first time\nthat Republican leaders put forth\na concrete market-based climate solution.\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 3:28\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 3:30\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 3:32\n\n\nWe presented our plan at the White House\ntwo weeks after President Trump moved in.\nAlmost every leading\neditorial board in the country\nhas since endorsed our plan,\nand Fortune 100 companies\nfrom a wide range of industries\nare now getting behind it.\nSo by now you're probably wondering,\nwhat exactly is this plan?\n\n\n\n 3:56\n\n\nWell, our carbon dividends solution\nis based on four pillars.\nThe first is a gradually\nrising carbon tax.\nAlthough capitalism is a wonderful system,\nlike many operating systems,\nit's prone to bugs,\nwhich, in this case, are called\n\"market failures.\"\nBy far the largest is that\nmarket prices fail to take\nsocial and environmental\ncosts into account.\nThat means every market transaction\nis based on incorrect information.\nThis fundamental bug of capitalism,\nmore than any other single factor,\nis to blame for our climate predicament.\n\n\n\n 4:33\n\n\nNow in theory, this should be\nan easy problem to fix.\nEconomists agree\nthat the best solution is to put a price\non the carbon content of fossil fuels,\notherwise known as a carbon tax.\nThis would discourage carbon emissions\nin every single economic transaction,\nevery day of the year.\nHowever, a carbon tax by itself\nhas proven to be unpopular\nand a political dead end.\nThe answer is to return\nall the money raised\ndirectly to citizens,\nin the form of equal monthly dividends.\nThis would transform\nan unpopular carbon tax\ninto a popular and populist solution,\nand it would also solve\nthe underlying psychological barrier\nthat we discussed,\nby giving everyone a concrete benefit\nin the here and now.\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nAnd these benefits would be significant.\nAssuming a carbon tax rate\nthat starts at 40 dollars per ton,\na family of four would receive\n2,000 dollars per year\nfrom the get-go.\nAccording to the US Treasury Department,\nthe bottom 70 percent of Americans\nwould receive more in dividends\nthan they would pay\nin increased energy prices.\nThat means 223 million Americans\nwould win economically\nfrom solving climate change.\nAnd that —\n\n\n\n 6:01\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:03\n\n\nis revolutionary,\nand could fundamentally\nalter climate politics.\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\nBut there's another\nrevolutionary element here.\nThe amount of the dividend would grow\nas the carbon tax rate increases.\nThe more we protect our climate,\nthe more our citizens benefit.\nThis creates a positive feedback loop,\nwhich is crucial,\nbecause the only way we will reach\nour long-term emission-reduction goals\nis if the carbon tax rate\ngoes up every year.\n\n\n\n 6:33\n\n\nThe third pillar of our program\nis eliminating regulations\nthat are no longer needed\nonce a carbon dividends plan is enacted.\nThis is a key selling point\nto Republicans and business leaders.\nSo why should we trade\nclimate regulations for a price on carbon?\nWell, let me show you.\nOur plan would achieve nearly twice\nthe emissions reductions\nof all Obama-era climate\nregulations combined,\nand nearly three times the new baseline\nafter President Trump repeals\nall of those regulations.\nThat assumes a carbon tax\nstarting at 40 dollars per ton,\nwhich translates into roughly\nan extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.\nOur plan by itself\nwould meet the high end\nof America's commitment\nunder the Paris Climate Agreement,\nand as you can see,\nthe emissions reductions\nwould continue over time.\nThis illustrates the power\nof a conservative climate solution\nbased on free markets\nand limited government.\nWe would end up with less regulation\nand far less pollution at the same time,\nwhile helping working-class\nAmericans get ahead.\nDoesn't that sound like something\nwe could all support?\n\n\n\n 7:58\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nThe fourth and final pillar of our program\nis a new climate domino effect,\nbased on border carbon adjustments.\nNow that may sound complicated,\nbut it, too, is revolutionary,\nbecause it provides us\na whole new strategy\nto reach a global price on carbon,\nwhich is ultimately what we need.\nLet me show you an example.\nSuppose Country A adopts\na carbon dividends plan,\nand Country B does not.\nWell, to level the playing field\nand protect the competitiveness\nof its industries,\nCountry A would tax imports from Country B\nbased on their carbon content.\nFair enough.\nBut here's where it gets\nreally interesting,\nbecause the money raised at the border\nwould increase the dividends\ngoing to the citizens of Country A.\nWell, how long do you think it would take\nthe public in Country B to realize\nthat that money should be going to them,\nand to push for a carbon\ndividends plan in their own land?\nAdd a few more countries,\nand we get a new climate domino effect.\n\n\n\n 9:06\n\n\nOnce one major country or region\nadopts carbon dividends\nwith border carbon adjustments,\nother countries are compelled\nto follow suit.\nOne by one the dominoes fall.\nAnd this domino effect\ncould start anywhere.\nMy preference, strongly,\nis the United States,\nbut it could also start\nin the United Kingdom,\nin Germany or another European country,\nor even in China.\n\n\n\n 9:31\n\n\nLet's take China as an example.\nChina is committed to reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\nbut what its leaders care even more about\nis transitioning their economy\nto consumer-led economic development.\nWell, nothing could do more\nto hasten that transition\nthan giving every Chinese citizen\na monthly dividend.\nIn fact, this is the only policy solution\nthat would enable China to meet\nits environmental and economic goals\nat the same time.\n\n\n\n 9:59\n\n\nThat's why this is the killer app\nof climate policy,\nbecause it would enable us to overcome\neach of the barriers we discussed earlier:\nthe psychological barrier,\nthe partisan barrier,\nand, as we've just seen,\nthe geopolitical barrier.\nAll we need is a country to lead the way.\nAnd one method of finding\nwhat you're looking for\nis to take out an ad.\nSo let's read this one together.\n\n\n\n10:25\n\n\nWanted: country to pioneer\ncarbon dividends plan.\nCost to country: zero.\nStarting date: as soon as possible.\nAdvantages: most effective\nclimate solution,\npopular and populist,\npro-growth and pro-business,\nshrinks government\nand helps the working class.\nAdditional compensation: gratitude\nof current and future generations,\nincluding my daughter.\n\n\n\n10:55\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n10:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:03\n\n\nChris Anderson: Just one\nquestion for you, Ted.\nI'm actually not sure\nI've seen a conservative\nget a standing O at TED before that.\nThat's pretty cool.\nThe logic seems really powerful,\nbut some people you talk to in politics\nsay it's hard to imagine this\nstill getting through Congress.\nHow are you feeling\nabout momentum behind this?\n\n\n\n11:25\n\n\nTed Halstead: So I understand\nthat many are very pessimistic\nabout what's happening in\nthe United States with President Trump.\nI'm less pessimistic; here's why.\nThe actions of this White House,\nthe early actions on climate,\nare just the first move\nin a complex game of climate chess.\nSo far it's been a repeal-only strategy;\nthe pressure is going to mount \nfor a replacement program,\nwhich is where we come in.\nAnd there are three reasons why,\nwhich I'll go through real quickly.\n\n\n\n11:52\n\n\nOne, the business community\nis fundamentally parting ways\nwith the White House on climate change.\nIn fact, we're finding\na number of Fortune 100 companies\nsupporting our program.\nWithin two months,\nwe're going to be announcing\nsome really surprising names\ncoming out in favor of this program.\nTwo, there is no issue\nin American politics\nwhere there's a more fundamental gap\nbetween the Republican base\nand the Republican leadership\nthan climate change.\nAnd three, thinking of\nthis analogy of chess,\nthe big decision up ahead is:\nDoes the administration stay in Paris?\nWell, let's pan it out both ways.\nIf it stays in Paris, as many\nare pushing for in the administration,\nwell then that begs a question:\nWhat's the plan?\nWe have the plan.\nBut if they don't stay in Paris,\nthe international pressure\nwill be overwhelming.\nOur Secretary of State will be asking\nother countries for NATO contributions,\nand they'll be saying,\n\"No, give us our Paris commitment.\nCome through on your commitments,\nwe'll come through on ours.\"\n\n\n\n12:50\n\n\nSo, international, business\nand even the Republican base\nwill all be calling for\na Republican replacement plan.\nAnd, hopefully, we've provided one.\n\n\n\n13:00\n\n\nCA: Thank you so much, Ted.\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\nTH: Thank you, Chris.\n\n\n\n13:03\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nImagine you're in Rome,\nand you've made your way\nto the Vatican Museums.\nAnd you've been shuffling\ndown long corridors,\npast statues, frescoes,\nlots and lots of stuff.\nYou're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.\nAt last — a long corridor,\na stair and a door.\nYou're at the threshold\nof the Sistine Chapel.\n\n\n\n 0:36\n\n\nSo what are you expecting?\nSoaring domes? Choirs of angels?\nWe don't really have any of that there.\nInstead, you may ask yourself,\nwhat do we have?\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nWell, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.\nAnd I mean literally, you're surrounded\nby painted curtains,\nthe original decoration of this chapel.\nChurches used tapestries not just\nto keep out cold during long masses,\nbut as a way to represent\nthe great theater of life.\nThe human drama in which each one of us\nplays a part is a great story,\na story that encompasses the whole world\nand that came to unfold\nin the three stages\nof the painting in the Sistine Chapel.\n\n\n\n 1:17\n\n\nNow, this building started out\nas a space for a small group\nof wealthy, educated Christian priests.\nThey prayed there.\nThey elected their pope there.\nFive hundred years ago,\nit was the ultimate\necclesiastical man cave.\nSo, you may ask, how can it be\nthat today it attracts and delights\nfive million people a year,\nfrom all different backgrounds?\nBecause in that compressed space,\nthere was a creative explosion,\nignited by the electric excitement\nof new geopolitical frontiers,\nwhich set on fire the ancient\nmissionary tradition of the Church\nand produced one of the greatest\nworks of art in history.\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nNow, this development took place\nas a great evolution,\nmoving from the beginning of a few elite,\nand eventually able to speak\nto audiences of people\nthat come from all over the world.\nThis evolution took place in three stages,\neach one linked\nto a historical circumstance.\nThe first one was rather limited in scope.\nIt reflected the rather\nparochial perspective.\nThe second one took place after\nworldviews were dramatically altered\nafter Columbus's historical voyage;\nand the third,\nwhen the Age of Discovery\nwas well under way\nand the Church rose to the challenge\nof going global.\n\n\n\n 2:39\n\n\nThe original decoration of this church\nreflected a smaller world.\nThere were busy scenes\nthat told the stories of the lives\nof Jesus and Moses,\nreflecting the development\nof the Jewish and Christian people.\nThe man who commissioned this,\nPope Sixtus IV,\nassembled a dream team of Florentine art,\nincluding men like Sandro Botticelli\nand the man who would become\nMichelangelo's future painting teacher,\nGhirlandaio.\nThese men, they blanketed the walls\nwith a frieze of pure color,\nand in these stories you'll notice\nfamiliar landscapes,\nthe artists using Roman monuments\nor a Tuscan landscape\nto render a faraway story,\nsomething much more familiar.\nWith the addition of images\nof the Pope's friends and family,\nthis was a perfect decoration\nfor a small court\nlimited to the European continent.\nBut in 1492, the New World was discovered,\nhorizons were expanding,\nand this little 133 by 46-foot\nmicrocosm had to expand as well.\nAnd it did,\nthanks to a creative genius,\na visionary and an awesome story.\n\n\n\n 3:51\n\n\nNow, the creative genius\nwas Michelangelo Buonarroti,\n33 years old when he was tapped\nto decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,\nand the deck was stacked against him —\nhe had trained in painting\nbut had left to pursue sculpture.\nThere were angry patrons in Florence\nbecause he had left a stack\nof incomplete commissions,\nlured to Rome by the prospect\nof a great sculptural project,\nand that project had fallen through.\nAnd he had been left with a commission\nto paint 12 apostles\nagainst a decorative background\nin the Sistine Chapel ceiling,\nwhich would look like\nevery other ceiling in Italy.\n\n\n\n 4:24\n\n\nBut genius rose to the challenge.\nIn an age when a man dared\nto sail across the Atlantic Ocean,\nMichelangelo dared to chart\nnew artistic waters.\nHe, too, would tell a story —\nno Apostles — but a story\nof great beginnings,\nthe story of Genesis.\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nNot really an easy sell,\nstories on a ceiling.\nHow would you be able to read\na busy scene from 62 feet below?\nThe painting technique that had been\nhanded on for 200 years\nin Florentine studios was not equipped\nfor this kind of a narrative.\n\n\n\n 4:56\n\n\nBut Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,\nand so he played to his strengths.\nInstead of being accustomed\nto filling space with busyness,\nhe took a hammer and chisel\nand hacked away at a piece of marble\nto reveal the figure within.\nMichelangelo was an essentialist;\nhe would tell his story\nin massive, dynamic bodies.\n\n\n\n 5:18\n\n\nThis plan was embraced\nby the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,\na man who was unafraid\nof Michelangelo's brazen genius.\nHe was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,\nand he had been steeped in art\nfor 30 years and he knew its power.\nAnd history has handed down the moniker\nof the Warrior Pope,\nbut this man's legacy to the Vatican —\nit wasn't fortresses and artillery,\nit was art.\nHe left us the Raphael Rooms,\nthe Sistine Chapel.\nHe left St. Peter's Basilica\nas well as an extraordinary collection\nof Greco-Roman sculptures —\ndecidedly un-Christian works\nthat would become the seedbed\nof the world's first modern museum,\nthe Vatican Museums.\nJulius was a man\nwho envisioned a Vatican\nthat would be eternally relevant\nthrough grandeur and through beauty,\nand he was right.\nThe encounter between these two giants,\nMichelangelo and Julius II,\nthat's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.\nMichelangelo was so committed\nto this project,\nthat he succeeded in getting the job done\nin three and a half years,\nusing a skeleton crew and spending\nmost of the time, hours on end,\nreaching up above his head\nto paint the stories on the ceiling.\n\n\n\n 6:32\n\n\nSo let's look at this ceiling\nand see storytelling gone global.\nNo more familiar artistic references\nto the world around you.\nThere's just space\nand structure and energy;\na monumental painted framework\nwhich opens onto nine panels,\nmore driven by sculptural form\nthan painterly color.\nAnd we stand in the far end\nby the entrance,\nfar from the altar and from the gated\nenclosure intended for the clergy\nand we peer into the distance,\nlooking for a beginning.\nAnd whether in scientific inquiry\nor in biblical tradition,\nwe think in terms of a primal spark.\nMichelangelo gave us an initial energy\nwhen he gave us the separation\nof light and dark,\na churning figure blurry in the distance,\ncompressed into a tight space.\nThe next figure looms larger,\nand you see a figure hurtling\nfrom one side to the next.\nHe leaves in his wake\nthe sun, the moon, vegetation.\nMichelangelo didn't focus\non the stuff that was being created,\nunlike all the other artists.\nHe focused on the act of creation.\n\n\n\n 7:46\n\n\nAnd then the movement stops,\nlike a caesura in poetry\nand the creator hovers.\nSo what's he doing?\nIs he creating land? Is he creating sea?\nOr is he looking back over his handiwork,\nthe universe and his treasures,\njust like Michelangelo must have,\nlooking back over his work in the ceiling\nand proclaiming, \"It is good.\"\n\n\n\n 8:09\n\n\nSo now the scene is set,\nand you get to the culmination\nof creation, which is man.\nAdam leaps to the eye, a light figure\nagainst a dark background.\nBut looking closer,\nthat leg is pretty languid on the ground,\nthe arm is heavy on the knee.\nAdam lacks that interior spark\nthat will impel him to greatness.\nThat spark is about to be conferred\nby the creator in that finger,\nwhich is one millimeter\nfrom the hand of Adam.\nIt puts us at the edge of our seats,\nbecause we're one moment\nfrom that contact,\nthrough which that man\nwill discover his purpose,\nleap up and take his place\nat the pinnacle of creation.\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\nAnd then Michelangelo threw a curveball.\nWho is in that other arm?\nEve, first woman.\nNo, she's not an afterthought.\nShe's part of the plan.\nShe's always been in his mind.\nLook at her, so intimate with God\nthat her hand curls around his arm.\nAnd for me, an American art historian\nfrom the 21st century,\nthis was the moment\nthat the painting spoke to me.\nBecause I realized that this\nrepresentation of the human drama\nwas always about men and women —\nso much so, that the dead center,\nthe heart of the ceiling,\nis the creation of woman, not Adam.\nAnd the fact is, that when you see them\ntogether in the Garden of Eden,\nthey fall together\nand together their proud posture\nturns into folded shame.\n\n\n\n 9:39\n\n\nYou are at critical juncture\nnow in the ceiling.\nYou are exactly at the point\nwhere you and I can go\nno further into the church.\nThe gated enclosure keeps us\nout of the inner sanctum,\nand we are cast out\nmuch like Adam and Eve.\nThe remaining scenes in the ceiling,\nthey mirror the crowded chaos\nof the world around us.\nYou have Noah and his Ark and the flood.\nYou have Noah. He's making a sacrifice\nand a covenant with God.\nMaybe he's the savior.\nOh, but no, Noah is the one\nwho grew grapes, invented wine,\ngot drunk and passed out\nnaked in his barn.\nIt is a curious way to design the ceiling,\nnow starting out with God creating life,\nending up with some guy\nblind drunk in a barn.\nAnd so, compared with Adam,\nyou might think Michelangelo\nis making fun of us.\n\n\n\n10:23\n\n\nBut he's about to dispel the gloom\nby using those bright colors\nright underneath Noah:\nemerald, topaz, scarlet\non the prophet Zechariah.\nZechariah foresees a light\ncoming from the east,\nand we are turned at this juncture\nto a new destination,\nwith sibyls and prophets\nwho will lead us on a parade.\nYou have the heroes and heroines\nwho make safe the way,\nand we follow the mothers and fathers.\nThey are the motors of this great\nhuman engine, driving it forward.\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\nAnd now we're at the keystone\nof the ceiling,\nthe culmination of the whole thing,\nwith a figure that looks like\nhe's about to fall out of his space\ninto our space,\nencroaching our space.\n\n\n\n11:04\n\n\nThis is the most important juncture.\nPast meets present.\nThis figure, Jonah, who spent\nthree days in the belly of the whale,\nfor the Christians, is the symbol\nof the renewal of humanity\nthrough Jesus' sacrifice,\nbut for the multitudes\nof visitors to that museum\nfrom all faiths who visit there every day,\nhe is the moment the distant past\nencounters and meets immediate reality.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\n\nAll of this brings us to the yawning\narchway of the altar wall,\nwhere we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,\npainted in 1534 after the world\nhad changed again.\nThe Reformation had splintered the Church,\nthe Ottoman Empire had made\nIslam a household word\nand Magellan had found a route\ninto the Pacific Ocean.\nHow is a 59-year-old artist who has never\nbeen any further than Venice\ngoing to speak to this new world?\nMichelangelo chose to paint destiny,\nthat universal desire,\ncommon to all of us,\nto leave a legacy of excellence.\nTold in terms of the Christian vision\nof the Last Judgment,\nthe end of the world,\nMichelangelo gave you a series of figures\nwho are wearing these\nstrikingly beautiful bodies.\nThey have no more covers,\nno more portraits\nexcept for a couple.\nIt's a composition only out of bodies,\n391, no two alike,\nunique like each and every one of us.\nThey start in the lower corner,\nbreaking away from the ground,\nstruggling and trying to rise.\nThose who have risen\nreach back to help others,\nand in one amazing vignette,\nyou have a black man and a white man\npulled up together\nin an incredible vision of human unity\nin this new world.\nThe lion's share of the space\ngoes to the winner's circle.\nThere you find men and women\ncompletely nude like athletes.\nThey are the ones\nwho have overcome adversity,\nand Michelangelo's vision\nof people who combat adversity,\novercome obstacles —\nthey're just like athletes.\nSo you have men and women\nflexing and posing\nin this extraordinary spotlight.\nPresiding over this assembly is Jesus,\nfirst a suffering man on the cross,\nnow a glorious ruler in Heaven.\nAnd as Michelangelo\nproved in his painting,\nhardship, setbacks and obstacles,\nthey don't limit excellence,\nthey forge it.\n\n\n\n13:27\n\n\nNow, this does lead us to one odd thing.\nThis is the Pope's private chapel,\nand the best way you can describe that\nis indeed a stew of nudes.\nBut Michelangelo was trying to use\nonly the best artistic language,\nthe most universal artistic language\nhe could think of:\nthat of the human body.\nAnd so instead of the way of showing\nvirtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,\nhe borrowed from Julius II's\nwonderful collection of sculptures\nin order to show inner strength\nas external power.\n\n\n\n13:58\n\n\nNow, one contemporary did write\nthat the chapel was too beautiful\nto not cause controversy.\nAnd so it did.\nMichelangelo soon found\nthat thanks to the printing press,\ncomplaints about the nudity\nspread all over the place,\nand soon his masterpiece of human drama\nwas labeled pornography,\nat which point he added\ntwo more portraits,\none of the man who criticized him,\na papal courtier,\nand the other one of himself\nas a dried up husk, no athlete,\nin the hands of a long-suffering martyr.\nThe year he died he saw\nseveral of these figures covered over,\na triumph for trivial distractions\nover his great exhortation to glory.\n\n\n\n14:39\n\n\nAnd so now we stand\nin the here and now.\nWe are caught in that space\nbetween beginnings and endings,\nin the great, huge totality\nof the human experience.\nThe Sistine Chapel forces us\nto look around as if it were a mirror.\nWho am I in this picture?\nAm I one of the crowd?\nAm I the drunk guy?\nAm I the athlete?\nAnd as we leave this haven\nof uplifting beauty,\nwe are inspired to ask ourselves\nlife's biggest questions:\nWho am I, and what role do I play\nin this great theater of life?\n\n\n\n15:12\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:13\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:17\n\n\nBruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.\n\n\n\n15:20\n\n\nElizabeth, you mentioned\nthis whole issue of pornography,\ntoo many nudes and too many\ndaily life scenes and improper things\nin the eyes of the time.\nBut actually the story is bigger.\nIt's not just touching up\nand covering up some of the figures.\nThis work of art was almost\ndestroyed because of that.\n\n\n\n15:39\n\n\nElizabeth Lev: The effect\nof the Last Judgment was enormous.\nThe printing press made sure\nthat everybody saw it.\nAnd so, this wasn't something\nthat happened within a couple of weeks.\nIt was something that happened\nover the space of 20 years\nof editorials and complaints,\nsaying to the Church,\n\"You can't possibly tell us\nhow to live our lives.\nDid you notice you have\npornography in the Pope's chapel?\"\nAnd so after complaints and insistence\nof trying to get this work destroyed,\nit was finally the year\nthat Michelangelo died\nthat the Church finally\nfound a compromise,\na way to save the painting,\nand that was in putting up\nthese extra 30 covers,\nand that happens to be\nthe origin of fig-leafing.\nThat's where it all came about,\nand it came about from a church\nthat was trying to save a work of art,\nnot indeed deface or destroyed it.\n\n\n\n16:27\n\n\nBG: This, what you just gave us,\nis not the classic tour\nthat people get today\nwhen they go to the Sistine Chapel.\n\n\n\n16:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:35\n\n\nEL: I don't know, is that an ad?\n\n\n\n16:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:39\n\n\nBG: No, no, no, not necessarily,\nit is a statement.\nThe experience of art today\nis encountering problems.\nToo many people want to see this there,\nand the result is five million people\ngoing through that tiny door\nand experiencing it\nin a completely different way\nthan we just did.\n\n\n\n16:55\n\n\nEL: Right. I agree. I think it's really\nnice to be able to pause and look.\nBut also realize,\neven when you're in those days,\nwith 28,000 people a day,\neven those days when you're in there\nwith all those other people,\nlook around you and think\nhow amazing it is\nthat some painted plaster\nfrom 500 years ago\ncan still draw all those people\nstanding side by side with you,\nlooking upwards with their jaws dropped.\nIt's a great statement about how beauty\ntruly can speak to us all\nthrough time and through geographic space.\n\n\n\n17:25\n\n\nBG: Liz, grazie.\n\n\n\n17:26\n\n\nEL: Grazie a te.\n\n\n\n17:28\n\n\nBG: Thank you.\n\n\n\n17:29\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nHave you ever heard the one\nabout how breastfeeding is free?\n\n\n\n 0:16\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:17\n\n\nYeah, it's pretty funny,\nbecause it's only free if we don't value\nwomen's time and energy.\nAny mother can tell you\nhow much time and energy it takes\nto liquify her body —\nto literally dissolve herself —\n\n\n\n 0:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:36\n\n\nas she feeds this precious\nlittle cannibal.\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:42\n\n\nMilk is why mammals suck.\nAt Arizona State University,\nin the Comparative Lactation Lab,\nI decode mothers' milk composition\nto understand its complexity\nand how it influences infant development.\nThe most important thing that I've learned\nis that we do not do enough\nto support mothers and babies.\nAnd when we fail mothers and babies,\nwe fail everyone\nwho loves mothers and babies:\nthe fathers, the partners,\nthe grandparents, the aunties,\nthe friends and kin\nthat make our human social networks.\nIt's time that we abandon\nsimple solutions and simple slogans,\nand grapple with the nuance.\n\n\n\n 1:31\n\n\nI was very fortunate\nto run smack-dab\ninto that nuance very early,\nduring my first interview\nwith a journalist\nwhen she asked me,\n\"How long should a mother\nbreastfeed her baby?\"\nAnd it was that word \"should\"\nthat brought me up short,\nbecause I will never tell a woman\nwhat she should do with her body.\n\n\n\n 1:57\n\n\nBabies survive and thrive\nbecause their mother's milk\nis food, medicine and signal.\nFor young infants,\nmother's milk is a complete diet\nthat provides all the building\nblocks for their bodies,\nthat shapes their brain\nand fuels all of their activity.\nMother's milk also feeds the microbes\nthat are colonizing\nthe infant's intestinal tract.\nMothers aren't just eating for two,\nthey're eating for two to the trillions.\nMilk provides immunofactors\nthat help fight pathogens\nand mother's milk provides hormones\nthat signal to the infant's body.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nBut in recent decades,\nwe have come to take milk for granted.\nWe stopped seeing\nsomething in plain sight.\nWe began to think of milk as standardized,\nhomogenized, pasteurized,\npackaged, powdered,\nflavored and formulated.\nWe abandoned the milk of human kindness\nand turned our priorities elsewhere.\n\n\n\n 2:57\n\n\nAt the National Institutes of Health\nin Washington DC\nis the National Library of Medicine,\nwhich contains 25 million articles —\nthe brain trust of life science\nand biomedical research.\nWe can use keywords\nto search that database,\nand when we do that,\nwe discover nearly a million\narticles about pregnancy,\nbut far fewer about\nbreast milk and lactation.\nWhen we zoom in on the number of articles\njust investigating breast milk,\nwe see that we know much more\nabout coffee, wine and tomatoes.\n\n\n\n 3:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:35\n\n\nWe know over twice as much\nabout erectile dysfunction.\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't\nknow about those things —\nI'm a scientist, I think\nwe should know about everything.\nBut that we know so much less —\n\n\n\n 3:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:52\n\n\nabout breast milk —\nthe first fluid a young mammal\nis adapted to consume —\nshould make us angry.\nGlobally, nine out of 10 women will\nhave at least one child in her lifetime.\nThat means that nearly 130 million\nbabies are born each year.\nThese mothers and babies\ndeserve our best science.\n\n\n\n 4:12\n\n\nRecent research has shown\nthat milk doesn't just grow the body,\nit fuels behavior\nand shapes neurodevelopment.\nIn 2015, researchers discovered\nthat the mixture of breast milk\nand baby saliva —\nspecifically, baby saliva —\ncauses a chemical reaction\nthat produces hydrogen peroxide\nthat can kill staph and salmonella.\nAnd from humans and other mammal species,\nwe're starting to understand\nthat the biological recipe of milk\ncan be different when produced\nfor sons or daughters.\nWhen we reach for donor milk\nin the neonatal intensive care unit,\nor formula on the store shelf,\nit's nearly one-size-fits-all.\nWe aren't thinking about how sons\nand daughters may grow at different rates,\nor different ways,\nand that milk may be a part of that.\n\n\n\n 5:01\n\n\nMothers have gotten the message\nand the vast majority of mothers\nintend to breastfeed,\nbut many do not reach\ntheir breastfeeding goals.\nThat is not their failure;\nit's ours.\nIncreasingly common medical conditions\nlike obesity, endocrine disorders,\nC-section and preterm births\nall can disrupt the underlying\nbiology of lactation.\nAnd many women do not have\nknowledgeable clinical support.\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nTwenty-five years ago,\nthe World Health Organization\nand UNICEF established criteria\nfor hospitals to be\nconsidered baby friendly —\nthat provide the optimal level\nof support for mother-infant bonding\nand infant feeding.\nToday, only one in five babies\nin the United States\nis born in a baby-friendly hospital.\nThis is a problem,\nbecause mothers can grapple\nwith many problems\nin the minutes, hours, days\nand weeks of lactation.\nThey can have struggles\nwith establishing latch,\nwith pain,\nwith milk letdown\nand perceptions of milk supply.\nThese mothers deserve\nknowledgeable clinical staff\nthat understand these processes.\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\nMothers will call me as they're\ngrappling with these struggles,\ncrying with wobbly voices.\n\"It's not working.\nThis is what I'm supposed\nto naturally be able to do.\nWhy is it not working?\"\nAnd just because something\nis evolutionarily ancient\ndoesn't mean that it's easy\nor that we're instantly good at it.\nYou know what else\nis evolutionarily ancient?\n\n\n\n 6:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:43\n\n\nSex.\nAnd nobody expects us\nto start out being good at it.\n\n\n\n 6:47\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:50\n\n\nClinicians best deliver\nquality equitable care\nwhen they have continuing education\nabout how to best support\nlactation and breastfeeding.\nAnd in order to have\nthat continuing education,\nwe need to anchor it\nto cutting-edge research\nin both the life sciences\nand the social sciences,\nbecause we need to recognize\nthat too often\nhistorical traumas and implicit biases\nsit in the space between\na new mother and her clinician.\nThe body is political.\nIf our breastfeeding support\nis not intersectional,\nit's not good enough.\nAnd for moms who have to return for work,\nbecause countries like the United States\ndo not provide paid parental leave,\nthey can have to go back in as short\nas just a few days after giving birth.\n\n\n\n 7:43\n\n\nHow do we optimize\nmother and infant health\njust by messaging\nabout breast milk to moms\nwithout providing\nthe institutional support\nthat facilitates\nthat mother-infant bonding\nto support breastfeeding?\nThe answer is: we can't.\nI'm talking to you, legislators,\nand the voters who elect them.\nI'm talking to you, job creators\nand collective bargaining units,\nand workers, and shareholders.\nWe all have a stake\nin the public health of our community,\nand we all have a role\nto play in achieving it.\nBreast milk is a part\nof improving human health.\nIn the NICU, when infants are born\nearly or sick or injured,\nmilk or bioactive constituents in milk\ncan be critically important.\nEnvironments or ecologies,\nor communities where there's\nhigh risk of infectious disease,\nbreast milk can be incredibly protective.\nWhere there are emergencies\nlike storms and earthquakes,\nwhen the electricity goes out,\nwhen safe water is not available,\nbreast milk can keep babies\nfed and hydrated.\nAnd in the context of humanitarian crises,\nlike Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,\nthe smallest drops can buffer babies\nfrom the biggest global challenges.\n\n\n\n 9:06\n\n\nBut understanding breast milk\nis not just about messaging to mothers\nand policy makers.\nIt's also about understanding\nwhat is important in breast milk\nso that we can deliver better formulas\nto moms who cannot or do not\nbreastfeed for whatever reason.\nWe can all do a better job\nof supporting the diversity\nof moms raising their babies\nin a diversity of ways.\n\n\n\n 9:31\n\n\nAs women around the world struggle\nto achieve political,\nsocial and economic equality,\nwe must reimagine motherhood\nas not the central,\ncore aspect of womanhood,\nbut one of the many potential facets\nof what makes women awesome.\n\n\n\n 9:50\n\n\nIt's time.\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nHave you ever wanted to stay young a little longer\nand put off aging?\nThis is a dream of the ages.\nBut scientists have for a long time\nthought this just was never going to be possible.\nThey thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it —\nkind of like an old shoe.\nBut if you look in nature,\nyou see that different kinds of animals\ncan have really different lifespans.\nNow these animals are different from one another,\nbecause they have different genes.\nSo that suggests\nthat somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,\nare genes for aging,\ngenes that allow them to have different lifespans.\nSo if there are genes like that,\nthen you can imagine that,\nif you could change one of the genes in an experiment,\nan aging gene,\nmaybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.\nAnd if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.\nAnd if they exist and you can find them,\nthen maybe one could eventually do something about it.\n\n\n\n 1:05\n\n\nSo we've set out to look for genes that control aging.\nAnd we didn't study any of these animals.\nInstead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,\nwhich is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.\nAnd we were really optimistic that we could find something\nbecause there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.\nSo we started to change genes at random,\nlooking for long-lived animals.\nAnd we were very lucky to find\nthat mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2\ndoubled the lifespan of the little worm.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nSo you can see in black, after a month —\nthey're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them\nfor studies of aging —\nin black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.\nBut at that time,\nmost of the mutant worms are still alive.\nAnd it isn't until twice as long\nthat they're all dead.\nAnd now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.\nSo the first thing you're going to see\nis the normal worm\nwhen it's about college student age — a young adult.\nIt's quite a cute little fellow.\nAnd next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.\nSo this animal is going to live twice as long.\nIs it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.\nIt's active. You can't tell the difference really.\nAnd they can be completely fertile —\nhave the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.\n\n\n\n 2:20\n\n\nNow get out your handkerchiefs here.\nYou're going to see, in just two weeks,\nthe normal worms are old.\nYou can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.\nBut everything else is just lying there.\nThe animal's clearly in the nursing home.\nAnd if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.\nYou know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans —\nwhich probably most of you haven't seen one —\nyou can tell they're old — isn't that interesting?\n\n\n\n 2:43\n\n\nSo there's something about aging that's kind of universal.\nAnd now here is the daf-2 mutant.\nOne gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.\nIt's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;\nit's going skiing.\nThis is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.\nIt takes this worm two days\nto age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.\nAnd when I tell people about this,\nthey tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person\nwho looks really good for being 90 or 80.\nBut it's really more like this:\nlet's say you're a 30 year-old guy — or in your 30s —\nand you're a bachelor and you're dating people.\nAnd you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.\nAnd you're in a restaurant, and you say, \"Well how old are you?\"\nShe says, \"I'm 60.\"\nThat's what it's like. And you would never know.\nYou would never know, until she told you.\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:35\n\n\nOkay.\nSo what is the daf-2 gene?\nWell as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,\nthey're instructions to make a protein that does something.\nAnd the daf-2 gene\nencodes a hormone receptor.\nSo what you see in the picture there\nis a cell with a hormone receptor in red\npunching through the edge of the cell.\nSo part of it is like a baseball glove.\nPart of it's on the outside,\nand it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.\nAnd the other part is on the inside\nwhere it sends signals into the cell.\n\n\n\n 4:04\n\n\nOkay, so what is the daf-2 receptor\ntelling the inside of the cell?\nI just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,\nthat you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;\nthe animal lives longer.\nSo that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor\nis to speed up aging.\nThat's what that arrow means.\nIt speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.\nSo it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,\nspeeding up aging.\nSo this is altogether really, really interesting.\nIt says that aging is subject to control by the genes,\nand specifically by hormones.\nSo what kind of hormones are these?\nThere's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.\nYou know about a lot of them.\nThese hormones are similar\nto hormones that we have in our bodies.\nThe daf-2 hormone receptor\nis very similar to the receptor\nfor the hormone insulin and IGF-1.\n\n\n\n 4:54\n\n\nNow you've all heard of at least insulin.\nInsulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients\ninto your tissues after you eat a meal.\nAnd the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.\nSo these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,\nbut our studies suggested\nthat maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about —\nmaybe they also affect aging.\nAnd it's looking like that's the case.\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\nSo after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,\npeople who worked on other kinds of animals\nstarted asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,\nthe hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,\nwill they live longer?\nAnd that is the case in flies.\nIf you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.\nAnd also in mice — and mice are mammals like us.\nSo it's an ancient pathway,\nbecause it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution\nsuch that it still works in all these animals.\nAnd also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.\n\n\n\n 5:46\n\n\nSo maybe it's working in people the same way.\nAnd there are hints of this.\nSo for example, there was one study that was done\nin a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.\nAnd just like any population,\nmost of the people live to be about 70 or 80,\nbut some live to be 90 or 100.\nAnd what they found\nwas that people who lived to 90 or 100\nwere more likely to have daf-2 mutations —\nthat is, changes in the gene\nthat encodes the receptor for IGF-1.\nAnd these changes made the gene not act as well\nas the normal gene would have acted.\nIt damaged the gene.\nSo those are hints\nsuggesting that humans are susceptible\nto the effects of the hormones for aging.\n\n\n\n 6:29\n\n\nSo the next question, of course, is:\nIs there any effect on age-related disease?\nAs you age, you're much more likely\nto get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,\nheart disease, all sorts of diseases.\nIt turns out that these long-lived mutants\nare more resistant to all these diseases.\nThey hardly get cancer,\nand when they do it's not as severe.\nSo it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,\nthat they're still young,\nso why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?\nSo it suggests\nthat, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take\nto replicate some of these effects in humans,\nmaybe we would have a way\nof combating lots of different age-related diseases\nall at once.\nSo how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?\nHow could that work?\n\n\n\n 7:13\n\n\nWell it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,\na whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA\nthat encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,\nand repair damage.\nAnd the way that they're switched on\nis by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.\nSo in a daf-2 mutant —\nyou see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.\nThe receptor isn't working as well.\nUnder those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue\nhas gone into the nucleus —\nthat little compartment there in the middle of the cell —\nand it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.\nYou see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.\nAnd it's just sitting on one of them.\n\n\n\n 7:49\n\n\nSo FOXO turns on a lot of genes.\nAnd the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,\ngenes I call carrot-giver genes,\nwhose protein products\nactually help other proteins to function well —\nto fold correctly and function correctly.\nAnd it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell\nand recycle them if they're damaged.\nDNA repair genes\nare more active in these animals.\nAnd the immune system is more active.\nAnd many of these different genes, we've shown,\nactually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.\nSo it's really interesting.\nThese animals have within them\nthe latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.\nThey have the ability\nto protect themselves from many kinds of damage,\nwhich we think makes them live longer.\n\n\n\n 8:33\n\n\nSo what about the normal worm?\nWell when the daf-2 receptor is active,\nthen it triggers a series of events\nthat prevent FOXO\nfrom getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.\nSo it can't turn the genes on.\nThat's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,\nuntil we have the daf-2 mutant.\nBut what good is this for the worm?\nWell we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones\nare hormones that are particularly active\nunder favorable conditions — in the good times —\nwhen food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.\nThen they promote the uptake of nutrients.\nYou can store the food, use it for energy,\ngrow, etc.\n\n\n\n 9:10\n\n\nBut what we think is that, under conditions of stress,\nthe levels of these hormones drop —\nfor example, having limited food supply.\nAnd that, we think,\nis registered by the animal as a danger signal,\na signal that things are not okay\nand that it should roll out its protective capacity.\nSo it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,\nand that triggers the expression of these genes\nthat improves the ability of the cell\nto protect itself and repair itself.\nAnd that's why we think the animals live longer.\n\n\n\n 9:38\n\n\nSo you can think of FOXO\nas being like a building superintendent.\nSo maybe he's a little bit lazy,\nbut he's there, he's taking care of the building.\nBut it's deteriorating.\nAnd then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.\nSo he doesn't actually do anything himself.\nHe gets on the telephone —\njust like FOXO gets on the DNA —\nand he calls up\nthe roofer, the window person,\nthe painter, the floor person.\nAnd they all come and they fortify the house.\nAnd then the hurricane comes through,\nand the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.\nAnd not only that, it can also just last longer,\neven if there isn't a hurricane.\nSo that's the concept here\nfor how we think this life extension ability exists.\n\n\n\n10:22\n\n\nNow the really cool thing about FOXO\nis that there are different forms of it.\nWe all have FOXO genes,\nbut we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.\nJust like we all have eyes,\nbut some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.\nAnd there are certain forms of the FOXO gene\nthat have found to be more frequently present\nin people who live to be 90 or 100.\nAnd that's the case all over the world,\nas you can see from these stars.\nAnd each one of these stars represents a population\nwhere scientists have asked,\n\"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes\namong people who live a really long time?\" and there are.\nWe don't know the details of how this works,\nbut we do know then\nthat FOXO genes can impact\nthe lifespan of people.\nAnd that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,\nwe can increase the health and longevity of people.\n\n\n\n11:12\n\n\nSo this is really exciting to me.\nA FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms\nto affect lifespan,\nand here it affects lifespan in people.\nSo we've been trying in our lab now\nto develop drugs\nthat will activate this FOXO cell\nusing human cells now\nin order to try and come up with drugs\nthat will delay aging and age-related diseases.\nAnd I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.\n\n\n\n11:36\n\n\nThere are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.\nAnd for at least one of them, there is a drug.\nThere's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,\nlike the insulin pathway.\nAnd mutations that damage the TOR gene —\njust like the daf-2 mutations —\nextend lifespan in worms\nand flies and mice.\nBut in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin\nthat binds to the TOR protein\nand inhibits its activity.\nAnd you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse —\neven when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,\nthat old for a mouse —\nif you give the mouse rapamycin,\nit will live longer.\n\n\n\n12:12\n\n\nNow I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.\nIt is a drug for people,\nbut the reason is it suppresses the immune system.\nSo people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.\nSo this may not be the perfect drug\nfor staying young longer.\nBut still, here in the year 2011,\nthere's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age\nthat will extend their lifespan,\nwhich comes out of this science\nthat's been done in all these different animals.\n\n\n\n12:38\n\n\nSo I'm really optimistic,\nand I think it won't be too long, I hope,\nbefore this age-old dream begins to come true.\n\n\n\n12:45\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:56\n\n\nMatt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.\nLet me get this straight.\nAlthough you're looking for a drug\nthat can solve aging\nin old men like me,\nwhat you could do now pretty well in the lab,\nif you were allowed ethically,\nis start a human life from scratch\nwith altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?\n\n\n\n13:19\n\n\nCK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about\nwould not change the genes,\nthey would just bind to the protein itself\nand change its activity.\nSo if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.\nYou could change the genes in principle.\nThere isn't the technology to do that.\nBut I don't think that's a good idea.\nAnd the reason is\nthat these hormones,\nlike the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,\nthey're essential.\nIf you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.\nSo it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully\nto get the benefits without getting any problems.\nAnd I think that's much better,\nthat kind of control would be much better as a drug.\nAnd also, there are other ways of activating FOXO\nthat don't even involve insulin or IGF-1\nthat might even be safer.\n\n\n\n14:08\n\n\nMR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...\n(Laughter)\nThere's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,\nwhich is a negligible senescence.\nThere are some creatures on this planet already\nthat don't really do aging.\nJust move to one side for us, if you would.\n\n\n\n14:30\n\n\nCK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.\nFor example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.\nAnd they grow to be about this size.\nAnd they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.\nAnd when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,\nyou can't tell the difference, just by looking,\nbetween those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.\nAnd the 70 year-old ones,\nactually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,\nand they also have more progeny every year.\nAnd there are other examples of these kinds of animals,\nlike turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.\nAnd nobody knows if they really can live forever,\nor what keeps them from aging.\nIt's not clear.\n\n\n\n15:09\n\n\nIf you look at birds, which live a long time,\ncells from the birds tend to be more resistant\nto a lot of different environmental stresses\nlike high temperature\nor hydrogen peroxide, things like that.\nAnd our long-lived mutants are too.\nThey're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.\nSo it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,\nwhich are set to run really quickly in the worm,\nhave a different normal set point\nin something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.\nAnd maybe they're even set really differently\nin animals with no senescence at all — but we don't know.\n\n\n\n15:42\n\n\nMR: But what you're talking about here\nis not extending human lifespan\nby preventing death,\nso much as extending human youthspan.\n\n\n\n15:51\n\n\nCK: Yes, that's right.\nIt's more like, say, if you were a dog.\nYou notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human\nand you think, \"Why isn't this human getting old?\"\nThey're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.\nIt's more like that.\nBut now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.\n\n\n\n16:07\n\n\nMR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.\n\n\n\n16:10\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'm going to tell you the story of a song.\nI was in Madrid one night in 2002\nwith my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,\nwhen he said he had something to give me.\nHe said,\n\"Jorge, I have some lines\nthat you need to put into a song.\nTake these down, take these down.\"\nI looked on the table but all I found\nwas a circular coaster,\non which I wrote the lines\nmy teacher dictated.\nThey were four lines that went like this:\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n\"I am a Jewish Moor\nliving among Christians\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\"\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nThose lines really made\nan impression on me.\nI said, \"What beautiful lyrics,\nJoaquín. Did you write them?\"\nHe said no, they were by another composer\nnamed Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,\nwho was less known than Joaquín,\nbut also a great poet.\nThese lines came to me at a time\nwhere I had been wanting\nto express something for a while,\nbut didn't quite know how.\n\n\n\n 1:08\n\n\nI was getting up to leave\nand go home to write,\nwhen Joaquín stopped me\nand said, \"Hang on, hang on,\"\nand presented me with this challenge:\n\"Write the stanzas for this song\nin Décimas.\"\nNow, at this point in my life,\nI still wasn't completely\nsure what Décimas were,\nbut I was too embarrassed\nto tell my teacher I didn't know.\nSo I put on my best\n\"Yeah, I totally understand\" face,\nand went home to look up\nwhat Décimas were.\nI learned that a Décima is a type of verse\nthat only exists in Spanish,\nand that it has 10 lines.\nIt's very, very complex —\nperhaps the most complex style of stanza\nthat we have in Spanish.\nIt also has a very concrete\ndate of origin,\nwhich is very rare for a style of stanza.\n\n\n\n 1:55\n\n\nThe Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,\nby a guy named Vicente Espinel,\na musician and poet from Málaga.\nAnd listen to this coincidence:\nhe was the same guy\nwho added the sixth string\nto what would later be called\nthe Spanish guitar.\nThis string right here —\nit's called the \"bordona.\"\n\n\n\n 2:17\n\n\nFrom Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,\ncrosses over to America,\njust like the Spanish guitar,\nbut in contrast to the Décima,\nthe Spanish guitar continues to live today\non both sides of the Atlantic.\nBut the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,\ndisappeared; it died out.\nIt died out about 200 years ago,\nand yet in Latin America,\nfrom Mexico to Chile,\nall our countries maintain\nsome form of the Décima\nin our popular traditions.\n\n\n\n 2:51\n\n\nIn each place, they've given it\na different name,\nand set it to different music.\nIt has a lot of different names —\nmore than 20 in total on the continent.\nIn Mexico, for example,\nit's called the \"Son Jarocho,\"\n\"Canto de mejorana\" in Panama;\n\"Galerón\" in Venezuela;\n\"Payada\" in Uruguay and Argentina;\n\"Repentismo\" in Cuba.\nIn Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,\nbecause the Décima becomes\nso integrated into our traditions,\nthat if someone asks, people\nfrom each place are completely convinced\nthat the Décima was invented\nin their country.\n\n\n\n 3:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:24\n\n\nIt's also got a really surprising feature,\nwhich is that despite the fact\nthat it developed independently\nin each of the different countries,\nit maintains even today,\n400 years after its creation,\nexactly the same rhyme,\nsyllable and line structure —\nthe same structure Vicente Espinel gave it\nduring the Spanish Baroque period.\nHere's the structure —\nI'll give you the basic idea\nand then later you can look online\nand learn more about it.\n\n\n\n 3:54\n\n\nThe Décima is ten lines long;\neach line has eight syllables.\nThe first line rhymes\nwith the fourth and the fifth;\nthe second line, with the third;\nthe sixth line,\nwith the seventh and the tenth;\nand the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.\nIt's a bit complicated, to be honest.\nAnd me — imagine me,\ntrying to write in Décimas.\nBut it's not as complicated as it seems.\nPlus, it's amazing that it's survived\nwith the same structure\nfor more than four centuries.\nIt's not that complicated, because it has\nan impressive musicality to it,\na type of musicality\nthat's very hard to describe technically.\nI prefer that you listen to it.\nSo I'm going to recite a Décima,\none of the Décimas\nthat I wrote for this song.\nI'm going to ask that you concentrate\njust on the musicality of the rhymes.\nFor those of you with headphones on —\nI see that some of you are listening\nto the translation —\nplease take them off for a minute.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\n(English) Take your headphones off,\nit you have them.\n\n\n\n 5:02\n\n\n(English) Forget about the meaning\nof the words for a few seconds,\n\n\n\n 5:08\n\n\n(English) and then you'll put them back.\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\n(English) Forget about the structure.\n\n\n\n 5:12\n\n\n(Spanish) Forget about the structure.\n\n\n\n 5:14\n\n\n(English) And just ... it's all about\nthe choreography of sound of the Décima.\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\n(Spanish) A choreography of sound.\n\n\n\n 5:23\n\n\n(Sings in Spanish) \"There is not one death\nthat does not cause me pain,\nthere are no winners,\nhere’s nothing but suffering\nand another life blown away.\nWar is a terrible school\nno matter what the disguise,\nforgive me for not enlisting\nunder any flag,\nany daydream is worth more\nthan a sad piece of cloth.\"\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\nThat's a Décima.\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\n(English) You can put\nyour headphones back on.\n\n\n\n 5:49\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\n(English) Thank you.\n\n\n\n 5:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nI also applaud Vicente Espinel,\nbecause here it is 426 years later,\nand the Décima lives on everywhere\nin its original state.\n\n\n\n 6:02\n\n\nI wrote three like that one;\nyou just heard the second.\nI wrote the first one having only\nrecently learned how,\nand it has some errors in terms of meter,\nso it's not presentable\nin its current state.\nBut the one I sang was good, more or less.\nSo: What was it about?\nWhat was the meaning behind those lines?\n\n\n\n 6:20\n\n\nI had just returned from doing\na concert in Israel,\nand I was very emotional over a problem\nthat hits really close to home,\nwhich is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nI'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,\nand my mom's family\nare non-practicing Christians.\nI was raised in a home\nwhere the two traditions lived together\nmore or less in harmony.\nIt wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa\ndressed as Santa Claus, for example,\nor to see my non-Jewish grandpa\nat the synagogue wearing his kippah,\nat family celebrations, wearing the same\nexpression that I probably had\nwhen Sabina told me —\n\n\n\n 6:55\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nthat he had some Décima lines for me.\nFor someone raised\nin that kind of environment,\nit's especially painful to see\nthe difficulty the opposing parties have\nin putting themselves in the other\nside's shoes even for a moment.\nSo that's what I wrote about.\n\n\n\n 7:15\n\n\nI already had the lyrics,\nI had the form — the Décima —\nand the content.\nI needed to write the music.\nI'll give you some context.\nI had only recently moved from Uruguay,\nwhere I'm from, to Spain.\nAnd I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,\nlike many of you here,\nwho are away from home.\nAnd I wanted my song\nto be very, very Uruguayan,\nthe most Uruguayan type of song\nthere is — the milonga.\nSo now, I had been studying the Décima,\nand after finding out\nthat everyone tried to claim\nthe Décima as their own,\nthat it was invented in their country,\nit made me wonder:\nWhat does it mean when we say\nthe milonga is Uruguayan?\n\n\n\n 7:57\n\n\nThe milonga has a rhythmic pattern\nthat we musicians call 3-3-2.\n\n\n\n 8:03\n\n\n(Counts out the beats) One two three,\none two three, one two.\n\n\n\n 8:10\n\n\nAnd it has a characteristic emphasis.\n\n\n\n 8:13\n\n\n(Sings)\n\n\n\n 8:21\n\n\nBut this characteristic rhythm pattern\ncomes from Africa.\nIn the ninth century you could find it\nin the brothels of Persia,\nand in the thirteenth,\nin Spain, from where,\nfive centuries later,\nit would cross over to America\nwith the African slaves.\nMeanwhile, in the Balkans,\nit encounters the Roma scale —\n\n\n\n 8:43\n\n\n(Sings)\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\nwhich in part, gives birth\nto klezmer music,\nwhich Ukrainian Jewish immigrants\nbring to Brooklyn, New York.\nThey sing it in their banquet halls.\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\n(Sings \"Hava Nagila\")\n\n\n\n 9:08\n\n\nAnd their neighbor,\nan Argentine kid of Italian origin\nnamed Astor Piazzolla,\nhears it,\nassimilates it\nand transforms the tango\nof the second half of the 20th century\nwith his ...\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\n(Counts out the beats) One two three,\none two three, one two.\n\n\n\n 9:25\n\n\n(Sings \"Adios Nonino\")\n\n\n\n 9:33\n\n\nHe also played it on his bandoneon,\na 19th-century German instrument\ncreated for churches\nthat weren't allowed to buy organs,\nand that ends up, incredibly,\nin Río de la Plata,\nforming the very essence\nof the tango and the milonga,\nin the very same way another instrument\njust as important as the bandoneon did:\nthe Spanish guitar.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:07\n\n\nTo which, by the way,\nVicente Espinel, in the 16th century,\nadded a sixth string.\nIt's amazing how all these things\nare coming full circle.\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\nWhat have I learned in these 15 years\nsince the song was born\nfrom going all over the world\nwith four lines written on a coaster\nfrom a bar in Madrid?\nThat Décimas,\nthe milonga,\nsongs, people —\nthe closer you get to them,\nthe more complex their identity becomes,\nand the more nuances and details appear.\nI learned that identity\nis infinitely dense,\nlike an infinite series of real numbers,\nand that even if you get very close\nand zoom in,\nit never ends.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\n\nBefore I sing you a song and say goodbye,\nallow me to tell you one last story.\nNot long ago, we were in Mexico\nafter a concert.\nAnd since the concert promoters know me,\nthey knew I was a Décima freak\nand that everywhere I go I ask about it,\ninsisting on hearing Décima artists.\nSo they organized a son jarocho show\nfor me at their house.\nIf you recall, the son jarocho\nis one of the styles of music\nthat uses Décimas in its verses.\n\n\n\n11:23\n\n\nWhen these amazing musicians\nfinished playing\nwhat is for me, something amazing,\nwhich is the son jarocho,\nthey finished playing and were ...\nI went up to greet them, really excited,\ngetting ready to thank them\nfor their gift of music,\nand this young kid says to me —\nand he says it with the best\nof intentions — he says,\n\"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping\nalive the purest origins\nof our Mexican identity.\"\nAnd to tell you the truth,\nI didn't really know what to say.\n\n\n\n11:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:59\n\n\nI stood there looking at him.\nI gave him a hug and left, but ...\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:03\n\n\nBut he was right, too, though. Right?\nIn reality, the Décima is its origin,\nbut at the same time,\njust like in the milonga\nand in the Décima,\nare the roots of many more cultures\nfrom all over the place, like he said.\n\n\n\n12:17\n\n\nLater, when I got back to the hotel,\nI thought about it for a while.\nAnd I thought:\nthings only look pure\nif you look at them from far away.\nIt's very important\nto know about our roots,\nto know where we come from,\nto understand our history.\nBut at the same time, as important\nas knowing where we're from,\nis understanding that deep down,\nwe're all from nowhere\nand a little bit from everywhere.\n\n\n\n12:46\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:57\n\n\nThis is \"The milonga of the Jewish Moor.\"\n\n\n\n13:01\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n13:13\n\n\n(Sings)\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\nFor every wall a lament\nin Jerusalem the golden\n\n\n\n13:23\n\n\nand 100 wasted lives\nfor every commandment.\n\n\n\n13:30\n\n\nI am dust in your wind\nand although I bleed through your wound,\n\n\n\n13:38\n\n\nand every beloved stone\nhas my deepest affection,\n\n\n\n13:44\n\n\nthere is not a stone in the world\nworth more than a human life.\n\n\n\n13:53\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n14:00\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n14:09\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n14:18\n\n\nThere is not one death that does not\ncause me pain, there are no winners\n\n\n\n14:26\n\n\nthere's nothing but suffering\nand another life blown away.\n\n\n\n14:33\n\n\nWar is a terrible school\nno matter what the disguise,\n\n\n\n14:40\n\n\nforgive me for not enlisting\nunder any flag,\n\n\n\n14:47\n\n\nany daydream is worth more\nthan a sad piece of cloth.\n\n\n\n14:56\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n15:03\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n15:11\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n15:24\n\n\nAnd nobody has my permission\nfor killing in my name,\n\n\n\n15:32\n\n\na man is but a man\nand if there is a God, this was his wish,\n\n\n\n15:39\n\n\nthe very ground I tread\nwill live on, once I am gone\n\n\n\n15:46\n\n\non my way to oblivion, and all doctrines\nwill suffer the same fate,\n\n\n\n15:53\n\n\nand there is not one nation\nthat has not proclaimed itself\n\n\n\n15:58\n\n\nthe chosen people.\n\n\n\n16:02\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n16:09\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n16:18\n\n\nI don't know who my God is,\nnor who my brothers are.\n\n\n\n16:23\n\n\nI am a Jewish Moor\nwho lives among Christians\n\n\n\n16:31\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n16:32\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:33\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhat keeps us healthy and happy\nas we go through life?\nIf you were going to invest now\nin your future best self,\nwhere would you put your time\nand your energy?\nThere was a recent survey of millennials\nasking them what their\nmost important life goals were,\nand over 80 percent said\nthat a major life goal for them\nwas to get rich.\nAnd another 50 percent\nof those same young adults\nsaid that another major life goal\nwas to become famous.\n\n\n\n 0:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:51\n\n\nAnd we're constantly told\nto lean in to work, to push harder\nand achieve more.\nWe're given the impression that these\nare the things that we need to go after\nin order to have a good life.\nPictures of entire lives,\nof the choices that people make\nand how those choices work out for them,\nthose pictures\nare almost impossible to get.\nMost of what we know about human life\nwe know from asking people\nto remember the past,\nand as we know, hindsight\nis anything but 20/20.\nWe forget vast amounts\nof what happens to us in life,\nand sometimes memory\nis downright creative.\n\n\n\n 1:35\n\n\nBut what if we could watch entire lives\nas they unfold through time?\nWhat if we could study people\nfrom the time that they were teenagers\nall the way into old age\nto see what really keeps people\nhappy and healthy?\n\n\n\n 1:54\n\n\nWe did that.\nThe Harvard Study of Adult Development\nmay be the longest study\nof adult life that's ever been done.\nFor 75 years, we've tracked\nthe lives of 724 men,\nyear after year, asking about their work,\ntheir home lives, their health,\nand of course asking all along the way\nwithout knowing how their life stories\nwere going to turn out.\n\n\n\n 2:24\n\n\nStudies like this are exceedingly rare.\nAlmost all projects of this kind\nfall apart within a decade\nbecause too many people\ndrop out of the study,\nor funding for the research dries up,\nor the researchers get distracted,\nor they die, and nobody moves the ball\nfurther down the field.\nBut through a combination of luck\nand the persistence\nof several generations of researchers,\nthis study has survived.\nAbout 60 of our original 724 men\nare still alive,\nstill participating in the study,\nmost of them in their 90s.\nAnd we are now beginning to study\nthe more than 2,000 children of these men.\nAnd I'm the fourth director of the study.\n\n\n\n 3:14\n\n\nSince 1938, we've tracked the lives\nof two groups of men.\nThe first group started in the study\nwhen they were sophomores\nat Harvard College.\nThey all finished college\nduring World War II,\nand then most went off\nto serve in the war.\nAnd the second group that we've followed\nwas a group of boys\nfrom Boston's poorest neighborhoods,\nboys who were chosen for the study\nspecifically because they were\nfrom some of the most troubled\nand disadvantaged families\nin the Boston of the 1930s.\nMost lived in tenements,\nmany without hot and cold running water.\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nWhen they entered the study,\nall of these teenagers were interviewed.\nThey were given medical exams.\nWe went to their homes\nand we interviewed their parents.\nAnd then these teenagers\ngrew up into adults\nwho entered all walks of life.\nThey became factory workers and lawyers\nand bricklayers and doctors,\none President of the United States.\nSome developed alcoholism.\nA few developed schizophrenia.\nSome climbed the social ladder\nfrom the bottom\nall the way to the very top,\nand some made that journey\nin the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n 4:34\n\n\nThe founders of this study\nwould never in their wildest dreams\nhave imagined that I would be\nstanding here today, 75 years later,\ntelling you that\nthe study still continues.\nEvery two years, our patient\nand dedicated research staff\ncalls up our men\nand asks them if we can send them\nyet one more set of questions\nabout their lives.\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nMany of the inner city Boston men ask us,\n\"Why do you keep wanting to study me?\nMy life just isn't that interesting.\"\nThe Harvard men never ask that question.\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nTo get the clearest picture\nof these lives,\nwe don't just send them questionnaires.\nWe interview them in their living rooms.\nWe get their medical records\nfrom their doctors.\nWe draw their blood, we scan their brains,\nwe talk to their children.\nWe videotape them talking with their wives\nabout their deepest concerns.\nAnd when, about a decade ago,\nwe finally asked the wives\nif they would join us\nas members of the study,\nmany of the women said,\n\"You know, it's about time.\"\n\n\n\n 5:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:50\n\n\nSo what have we learned?\nWhat are the lessons that come\nfrom the tens of thousands of pages\nof information that we've generated\non these lives?\nWell, the lessons aren't about wealth\nor fame or working harder and harder.\nThe clearest message that we get\nfrom this 75-year study is this:\nGood relationships keep us\nhappier and healthier. Period.\n\n\n\n 6:22\n\n\nWe've learned three big lessons\nabout relationships.\nThe first is that social connections\nare really good for us,\nand that loneliness kills.\nIt turns out that people\nwho are more socially connected\nto family, to friends, to community,\nare happier, they're physically healthier,\nand they live longer\nthan people who are less well connected.\nAnd the experience of loneliness\nturns out to be toxic.\nPeople who are more isolated\nthan they want to be from others\nfind that they are less happy,\ntheir health declines earlier in midlife,\ntheir brain functioning declines sooner\nand they live shorter lives\nthan people who are not lonely.\nAnd the sad fact\nis that at any given time,\nmore than one in five Americans\nwill report that they're lonely.\n\n\n\n 7:18\n\n\nAnd we know that you\ncan be lonely in a crowd\nand you can be lonely in a marriage,\nso the second big lesson that we learned\nis that it's not just\nthe number of friends you have,\nand it's not whether or not\nyou're in a committed relationship,\nbut it's the quality\nof your close relationships that matters.\nIt turns out that living in the midst\nof conflict is really bad for our health.\nHigh-conflict marriages, for example,\nwithout much affection,\nturn out to be very bad for our health,\nperhaps worse than getting divorced.\nAnd living in the midst of good,\nwarm relationships is protective.\n\n\n\n 7:56\n\n\nOnce we had followed our men\nall the way into their 80s,\nwe wanted to look back at them at midlife\nand to see if we could predict\nwho was going to grow\ninto a happy, healthy octogenarian\nand who wasn't.\nAnd when we gathered together\neverything we knew about them\nat age 50,\nit wasn't their middle age\ncholesterol levels\nthat predicted how they\nwere going to grow old.\nIt was how satisfied they were\nin their relationships.\nThe people who were the most satisfied\nin their relationships at age 50\nwere the healthiest at age 80.\nAnd good, close relationships\nseem to buffer us\nfrom some of the slings and arrows\nof getting old.\nOur most happily partnered men and women\nreported, in their 80s,\nthat on the days\nwhen they had more physical pain,\ntheir mood stayed just as happy.\nBut the people who were\nin unhappy relationships,\non the days when they\nreported more physical pain,\nit was magnified by more emotional pain.\n\n\n\n 9:03\n\n\nAnd the third big lesson that we learned\nabout relationships and our health\nis that good relationships\ndon't just protect our bodies,\nthey protect our brains.\nIt turns out that being\nin a securely attached relationship\nto another person in your 80s\nis protective,\nthat the people who are in relationships\nwhere they really feel they can count\non the other person in times of need,\nthose people's memories\nstay sharper longer.\nAnd the people in relationships\nwhere they feel they really\ncan't count on the other one,\nthose are the people who experience\nearlier memory decline.\nAnd those good relationships,\nthey don't have to be smooth all the time.\nSome of our octogenarian couples\ncould bicker with each other\nday in and day out,\nbut as long as they felt that they\ncould really count on the other\nwhen the going got tough,\nthose arguments didn't take a toll\non their memories.\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nSo this message,\nthat good, close relationships\nare good for our health and well-being,\nthis is wisdom that's as old as the hills.\nWhy is this so hard to get\nand so easy to ignore?\nWell, we're human.\nWhat we'd really like is a quick fix,\nsomething we can get\nthat'll make our lives good\nand keep them that way.\nRelationships are messy\nand they're complicated\nand the hard work of tending\nto family and friends,\nit's not sexy or glamorous.\nIt's also lifelong. It never ends.\nThe people in our 75-year study\nwho were the happiest in retirement\nwere the people who had actively worked\nto replace workmates with new playmates.\nJust like the millennials\nin that recent survey,\nmany of our men when they\nwere starting out as young adults\nreally believed that fame and wealth\nand high achievement\nwere what they needed to go after\nto have a good life.\nBut over and over, over these 75 years,\nour study has shown\nthat the people who fared the best were\nthe people who leaned in to relationships,\nwith family, with friends, with community.\n\n\n\n11:20\n\n\nSo what about you?\nLet's say you're 25,\nor you're 40, or you're 60.\nWhat might leaning in\nto relationships even look like?\n\n\n\n11:30\n\n\nWell, the possibilities\nare practically endless.\nIt might be something as simple\nas replacing screen time with people time\nor livening up a stale relationship\nby doing something new together,\nlong walks or date nights,\nor reaching out to that family member\nwho you haven't spoken to in years,\nbecause those all-too-common family feuds\ntake a terrible toll\non the people who hold the grudges.\n\n\n\n12:03\n\n\nI'd like to close with a quote\nfrom Mark Twain.\nMore than a century ago,\nhe was looking back on his life,\nand he wrote this:\n\"There isn't time, so brief is life,\nfor bickerings, apologies,\nheartburnings, callings to account.\nThere is only time for loving,\nand but an instant,\nso to speak, for that.\"\n\n\n\n12:33\n\n\nThe good life is built\nwith good relationships.\n\n\n\n12:38\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nThe school of architecture\nthat I studied at some 30 years ago\nhappened to be across the street\nfrom the wonderful art gallery\ndesigned by the great\narchitect Louis Kahn.\nI love the building,\nand I used to visit it quite often.\nOne day,\nI saw the security guard run his hand\nacross the concrete wall.\nAnd it was the way he did it,\nthe expression on his face —\nsomething touched me.\nI could see that the security guard\nwas moved by the building\nand that architecture has that capacity\nto move you.\nI could see it, and I remember thinking,\n\"Wow. How does architecture do that?\"\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nAt school, I was learning to design,\nbut here — here was\na reaction of the heart.\nAnd it touched me to the core.\n\n\n\n 1:16\n\n\nYou know, you aspire for beauty,\nfor sensuousness, for atmosphere,\nthe emotional response.\nThat's the realm of the ineffable\nand the immeasurable.\nAnd that's what you live for:\na chance to try.\n\n\n\n 1:38\n\n\nSo in 2003, there was\nan open call for designs\nfor the Bahá'í Temple for South America.\nThis was the first temple\nin all of South America.\nIt's a continental temple,\na hugely important milestone\nfor the Bahá'í community,\nbecause this would be the last\nof the continental temples\nand would open the door\nfor national and local temples to be built\naround the world.\n\n\n\n 2:01\n\n\nAnd the brief was deceptively simple\nand unique in the annals of religion:\na circular room, nine sides,\nnine entrances, nine paths,\nallowing you to come to the temple\nfrom all directions,\nnine symbolizing completeness,\nperfection.\nNo pulpit, no sermons,\nas there are no clergy\nin the Bahá'í faith.\nAnd in a world which is putting up walls,\nthe design needed to express in form\nthe very opposite.\nIt had to be open, welcoming\nto people of all faiths,\nwalks of life, backgrounds,\nor no faith at all;\na new form of sacred space\nwith no pattern\nor models to draw from.\nIt was like designing one of the first\nchurches for Christianity\nor one of the first mosques for Islam.\n\n\n\n 3:13\n\n\nSo we live in a secular world.\nHow do you design sacred space today?\nAnd how do you even define\nwhat's sacred today?\n\n\n\n 3:32\n\n\nI stumbled across this beautiful quote\nfrom the Bahá'í writings,\nand it speaks to prayer.\nIt says that if you reach out in prayer,\nand if your prayer is answered —\nwhich is already very interesting —\nthat the pillars of your heart\nwill become ashine.\n\n\n\n 3:53\n\n\nAnd I loved this idea\nof the inner and the outer,\nlike when you see someone\nand you say, \"That person is radiant.\"\nAnd I was thinking, \"My gosh,\nhow could we make something\narchitectural out of that,\nwhere you create a building\nand it becomes alive with light?\nLike alabaster, if you kiss it with light,\nit becomes alive.\nAnd I drew this sketch,\nsomething with two layers, translucent\nwith structure in between capturing light.\nMaybe a pure form,\na single form of emanation\nthat you could imagine\nwould be all dome\nand everything we kept making\nwas looking too much like an egg.\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:48\n\n\nA blob.\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\nSo you search.\nYou all know this crazy search,\nletting the process take you,\nand you live for the surprises.\nAnd I remember quite by accident\nI saw this little video\nof a plant moving in light,\nand it made me think of movement,\nreach,\nthis idea that the temple\ncould have reach,\nlike this reach for the divine.\nYou can imagine also\nthat movement within a circle\ncould mean movement and stillness,\nlike the cosmos,\nsomething you see in many places.\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:31\n\n\nBut rotation was not enough,\nbecause we needed a form.\nIn the Bahá'í writings, it talks about\nthe temples being as perfect\nas is humanly possible,\nand we kept thinking,\nwell, what is perfection?\nAnd I remember I stumbled into this image\nof this Japanese basket\nand thinking our Western notions\nof perfection need to be challenged,\nthat this wonderful silhouette\nof this basket, this wonkiness,\nand that it has the kind of dimple\nof what you might imagine a shoulder\nor the cheekbone,\nand that kind of organic form.\nAnd so we drew and made models,\nthese lines that merge at the top,\nsoft lines,\nwhich became like drapery\nand translucent veils and folding,\nand the idea of not only\nfolding but torquing —\nyou remember the plant\nand the way it was reaching.\nAnd this started to become\nan interesting form,\ncarving the base, making the entrances.\n\n\n\n 6:40\n\n\nAnd then we ended up with this.\nThis is this temple with two layers,\nnine luminous veils,\nembodied light,\nsoft-flowing lines\nlike luminescent drapery.\n180 submissions\nwere received from 80 countries,\nand this was selected.\n\n\n\n 7:01\n\n\nSo we went to the next stage\nof how to build it.\nWe had submitted alabaster.\nBut alabaster was too soft,\nand we were experimenting,\nmany experiments with materials,\ntrying to think how we could have\nthis kind of shimmer,\nand we ended up with borosilicate.\nAnd borosilicate glass,\nas you know, is very strong,\nand if you break borosilicate rods\njust so and melt them\nat just the right temperature,\nwe ended up with this new material,\nthis new cast glass which took us\nabout two years to make.\nAnd it had this quality that we loved,\nthis idea of the embodied light,\nbut on the inside, we wanted\nsomething with a soft light,\nlike the inner lining of a jacket.\nOn the outside you have protection,\nbut on the inside you touch it.\nSo we found this tiny vein\nin a huge quarry in Portugal\nwith this beautiful stone,\nwhich the owner had kept\nfor seven generations in his family,\nwaiting for the right project,\nif you can believe it.\nLook at this material, it's beautiful.\nAnd the way it lights up;\nit has that translucent quality.\n\n\n\n 8:25\n\n\nSo here you see the structure.\nIt lets the light through.\nAnd looking down,\nthe nine wings are bound,\nstructurally but symbolically strong,\na great symbol of unity:\npure geometry, a perfect circle,\n30 meters in section and in plan,\nperfectly symmetrical,\nlike the idea of sacredness and geometry.\nAnd here you see the building going up,\n2,000 steel nodes,\n9,000 pieces of steel,\n7,800 stone pieces,\n10,000 cast glass pieces,\nall individual shapes,\nthe entire superstructure all described,\nengineered, fabricated\nwith aerospace technology,\nprefabricated machine to machine,\nrobotically,\na huge team effort, you can imagine,\nof literally hundreds,\nand within three percent\nof our $30 million budget\nset in 2006.\n\n\n\n 9:37\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:41\n\n\nNine wings bound together\nforming a nine-pointed star,\nand the star shape moving in space,\ntracking the sun.\n\n\n\n10:06\n\n\nSo here it is.\n\n\n\n10:08\n\n\nAudience: Wow!\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:18\n\n\nHopefully, a befitting response\nto that beautiful quote,\n\"a prayer answered,\"\nopen in all directions,\ncapturing the blue light of dawn,\ntent-like white light of day,\nthe gold light of the afternoon,\nand of course, at night, the reversal:\nsensuous,\ncatching the light in all kinds\nof mysterious ways.\n\n\n\n10:52\n\n\nAnd the site: it's interesting;\n14 years ago when we made the submission,\nwe showed the temple\nset against the Andes.\nWe didn't have the Andes as our site,\nbut after nine years, that's exactly\nwhere we ended up,\nthe lines of the temple set against\nnothing but pure nature,\nand you turn around and you get\nnothing but the city below you,\nand inside, a view in all directions,\nradiating gardens\nfrom each of the alcoves,\nradiating paths.\n\n\n\n11:35\n\n\nLast October, the opening ceremonies —\na beautiful, sacred event,\n5,000 people from 80 countries,\na continuous river of visitors,\nindigenous people\nfrom all over South America,\nsome who had never left their villages.\nAnd of course, that this temple\nbelongs to people,\nthe collective, of many cultures\nand walks of life,\nmany beliefs,\nand for me, what's most important\nis what it feels like on the inside;\nthat it feel intimate,\nsacred,\nand that everyone is welcome.\nAnd if even a few who come\nhave the same reaction\nas that security guard,\nthen it truly would be their temple.\nAnd I would love that.\n\n\n\n12:37\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nMeet Tony. He's my student.\nHe's about my age,\nand he's in San Quentin State Prison.\nWhen Tony was 16 years old,\none day, one moment,\n\"It was mom's gun.\nJust flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.\nHe took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.\nThen last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'\nMy buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'\nI say, 'Let's do this.'\"\nAnd those three words, Tony's going to remember,\nbecause the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.\nThere's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.\nAnd that's felony murder —\n25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,\nand Tony's not feeling very lucky.\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\nSo when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison\nand I say, \"In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,\"\nTony interrupts me.\n\"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?\nI know what is wrong. I have done wrong.\nI am told every day,\nby every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.\nIf I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.\nI'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'\nWhat are you going to tell me about right and wrong?\"\n\n\n\n 1:20\n\n\nSo I say to Tony,\n\"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.\nYou think you know right and wrong?\nThen can you tell me what wrong is?\nNo, don't just give me an example.\nI want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.\nWhat is that idea?\nWhat makes something wrong?\nHow do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.\nMaybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.\nMaybe it's you, maybe it's me — but we're not here to trade opinions;\neveryone's got an opinion.\nWe are here for knowledge.\nOur enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy.\"\n\n\n\n 1:54\n\n\nAnd something changes for Tony.\n\"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.\nI want to know what is wrong.\nI want to know what I know.\"\nWhat Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,\nthe project that begins in wonder —\nwhat Kant called \"admiration and awe\nat the starry sky above and the moral law within.\"\nWhat can creatures like us know of such things?\nIt is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence —\nwhat Heidegger called \"the always already there.\"\nIt is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it —\nwhat Socrates called \"the examined life.\"\nSocrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.\nSocrates died in prison,\nhis philosophy intact.\n\n\n\n 2:38\n\n\nSo Tony starts doing his homework.\nHe learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,\nhis logic, his fallacies.\nTurns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.\nHis body is in prison, but his mind is free.\nTony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,\nthe epistemologically anxious,\nthe ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.\nThat's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche\nand Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n 2:59\n\n\nSo when he gives me his final paper,\nin which he argues that the categorical imperative\nis perhaps too uncompromising\nto deal with the conflict that affects our everyday\nand challenges me to tell him\nwhether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,\nI say, \"I don't know.\nLet us think about that.\"\nBecause in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;\nit's just the two of us standing there.\nIt is not professor and convict,\nit is just two minds ready to do philosophy.\nAnd I say to Tony,\n\"Let's do this.\"\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:13\n\n\nI'm going to talk a little bit\nabout where technology's going.\nAnd often technology comes to us,\nwe're surprised by what it brings.\nBut there's actually\na large aspect of technology\nthat's much more predictable,\nand that's because technological systems\nof all sorts have leanings,\nthey have urgencies,\nthey have tendencies.\nAnd those tendencies are derived\nfrom the very nature of the physics,\nchemistry of wires\nand switches and electrons,\nand they will make reoccurring\npatterns again and again.\nAnd so those patterns produce\nthese tendencies, these leanings.\n\n\n\n 0:53\n\n\nYou can almost think of it\nas sort of like gravity.\nImagine raindrops falling into a valley.\nThe actual path of a raindrop\nas it goes down the valley\nis unpredictable.\nWe cannot see where it's going,\nbut the general direction\nis very inevitable:\nit's downward.\nAnd so these baked-in\ntendencies and urgencies\nin technological systems\ngive us a sense of where things\nare going at the large form.\nSo in a large sense,\nI would say that telephones\nwere inevitable,\nbut the iPhone was not.\nThe Internet was inevitable,\nbut Twitter was not.\n\n\n\n 1:32\n\n\nSo we have many ongoing\ntendencies right now,\nand I think one of the chief among them\nis this tendency to make things\nsmarter and smarter.\nI call it cognifying — cognification —\nalso known as artificial\nintelligence, or AI.\nAnd I think that's going to be one\nof the most influential developments\nand trends and directions and drives\nin our society in the next 20 years.\n\n\n\n 1:59\n\n\nSo, of course, it's already here.\nWe already have AI,\nand often it works in the background,\nin the back offices of hospitals,\nwhere it's used to diagnose X-rays\nbetter than a human doctor.\nIt's in legal offices,\nwhere it's used to go\nthrough legal evidence\nbetter than a human paralawyer.\nIt's used to fly the plane\nthat you came here with.\nHuman pilots only flew it\nseven to eight minutes,\nthe rest of the time the AI was driving.\nAnd of course, in Netflix and Amazon,\nit's in the background,\nmaking those recommendations.\nThat's what we have today.\n\n\n\n 2:33\n\n\nAnd we have an example, of course,\nin a more front-facing aspect of it,\nwith the win of the AlphaGo, who beat\nthe world's greatest Go champion.\nBut it's more than that.\nIf you play a video game,\nyou're playing against an AI.\nBut recently, Google taught their AI\nto actually learn how to play video games.\nAgain, teaching video games\nwas already done,\nbut learning how to play\na video game is another step.\nThat's artificial smartness.\nWhat we're doing is taking\nthis artificial smartness\nand we're making it smarter and smarter.\n\n\n\n 3:17\n\n\nThere are three aspects\nto this general trend\nthat I think are underappreciated;\nI think we would understand\nAI a lot better\nif we understood these three things.\nI think these things also would\nhelp us embrace AI,\nbecause it's only by embracing it\nthat we actually can steer it.\nWe can actually steer the specifics\nby embracing the larger trend.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nSo let me talk about\nthose three different aspects.\nThe first one is: our own intelligence\nhas a very poor understanding\nof what intelligence is.\nWe tend to think of intelligence\nas a single dimension,\nthat it's kind of like a note\nthat gets louder and louder.\nIt starts like with IQ measurement.\nIt starts with maybe a simple\nlow IQ in a rat or mouse,\nand maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,\nand then maybe there's more\nin a stupid person,\nand then maybe an average\nperson like myself,\nand then maybe a genius.\nAnd this single IQ intelligence\nis getting greater and greater.\nThat's completely wrong.\nThat's not what intelligence is —\nnot what human intelligence is, anyway.\nIt's much more like a symphony\nof different notes,\nand each of these notes is played\non a different instrument of cognition.\n\n\n\n 4:26\n\n\nThere are many types\nof intelligences in our own minds.\nWe have deductive reasoning,\nwe have emotional intelligence,\nwe have spatial intelligence;\nwe have maybe 100 different types\nthat are all grouped together,\nand they vary in different strengths\nwith different people.\nAnd of course, if we go to animals,\nthey also have another basket —\nanother symphony of different\nkinds of intelligences,\nand sometimes those same instruments\nare the same that we have.\nThey can think in the same way,\nbut they may have a different arrangement,\nand maybe they're higher\nin some cases than humans,\nlike long-term memory in a squirrel\nis actually phenomenal,\nso it can remember\nwhere it buried its nuts.\nBut in other cases they may be lower.\n\n\n\n 5:09\n\n\nWhen we go to make machines,\nwe're going to engineer\nthem in the same way,\nwhere we'll make some of those types\nof smartness much greater than ours,\nand many of them won't be\nanywhere near ours,\nbecause they're not needed.\nSo we're going to take these things,\nthese artificial clusters,\nand we'll be adding more varieties\nof artificial cognition to our AIs.\nWe're going to make them\nvery, very specific.\n\n\n\n 5:37\n\n\nSo your calculator is smarter\nthan you are in arithmetic already;\nyour GPS is smarter\nthan you are in spatial navigation;\nGoogle, Bing, are smarter\nthan you are in long-term memory.\nAnd we're going to take, again,\nthese kinds of different types of thinking\nand we'll put them into, like, a car.\nThe reason why we want to put them\nin a car so the car drives,\nis because it's not driving like a human.\nIt's not thinking like us.\nThat's the whole feature of it.\nIt's not being distracted,\nit's not worrying about whether\nit left the stove on,\nor whether it should have\nmajored in finance.\nIt's just driving.\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:17\n\n\nJust driving, OK?\nAnd we actually might even\ncome to advertise these\nas \"consciousness-free.\"\nThey're without consciousness,\nthey're not concerned about those things,\nthey're not distracted.\n\n\n\n 6:28\n\n\nSo in general, what we're trying to do\nis make as many different\ntypes of thinking as we can.\nWe're going to populate the space\nof all the different possible types,\nor species, of thinking.\nAnd there actually may be some problems\nthat are so difficult\nin business and science\nthat our own type of human thinking\nmay not be able to solve them alone.\nWe may need a two-step program,\nwhich is to invent new kinds of thinking\nthat we can work alongside of to solve\nthese really large problems,\nsay, like dark energy or quantum gravity.\n\n\n\n 7:07\n\n\nWhat we're doing\nis making alien intelligences.\nYou might even think of this\nas, sort of, artificial aliens\nin some senses.\nAnd they're going to help\nus think different,\nbecause thinking different\nis the engine of creation\nand wealth and new economy.\n\n\n\n 7:24\n\n\nThe second aspect of this\nis that we are going to use AI\nto basically make a second\nIndustrial Revolution.\nThe first Industrial Revolution\nwas based on the fact\nthat we invented something\nI would call artificial power.\nPrevious to that,\nduring the Agricultural Revolution,\neverything that was made\nhad to be made with human muscle\nor animal power.\nThat was the only way\nto get anything done.\nThe great innovation during\nthe Industrial Revolution was,\nwe harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,\nto make this artificial power\nthat we could use\nto do anything we wanted to do.\nSo today when you drive down the highway,\nyou are, with a flick of the switch,\ncommanding 250 horses —\n250 horsepower —\nwhich we can use to build skyscrapers,\nto build cities, to build roads,\nto make factories that would churn out\nlines of chairs or refrigerators\nway beyond our own power.\nAnd that artificial power can also\nbe distributed on wires on a grid\nto every home, factory, farmstead,\nand anybody could buy\nthat artificial power,\njust by plugging something in.\n\n\n\n 8:38\n\n\nSo this was a source\nof innovation as well,\nbecause a farmer could take\na manual hand pump,\nand they could add this artificial\npower, this electricity,\nand he'd have an electric pump.\nAnd you multiply that by thousands\nor tens of thousands of times,\nand that formula was what brought us\nthe Industrial Revolution.\nAll the things that we see,\nall this progress that we now enjoy,\nhas come from the fact\nthat we've done that.\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\nWe're going to do\nthe same thing now with AI.\nWe're going to distribute that on a grid,\nand now you can take that electric pump.\nYou can add some artificial intelligence,\nand now you have a smart pump.\nAnd that, multiplied by a million times,\nis going to be this second\nIndustrial Revolution.\nSo now the car is going down the highway,\nit's 250 horsepower,\nbut in addition, it's 250 minds.\nThat's the auto-driven car.\nIt's like a new commodity;\nit's a new utility.\nThe AI is going to flow\nacross the grid — the cloud —\nin the same way electricity did.\n\n\n\n 9:33\n\n\nSo everything that we had electrified,\nwe're now going to cognify.\nAnd I would suggest, then,\nthat the formula\nfor the next 10,000 start-ups\nis very, very simple,\nwhich is to take x and add AI.\nThat is the formula,\nthat's what we're going to be doing.\nAnd that is the way\nin which we're going to make\nthis second Industrial Revolution.\nAnd by the way — right now, this minute,\nyou can log on to Google\nand you can purchase\nAI for six cents, 100 hits.\nThat's available right now.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nSo the third aspect of this\nis that when we take this AI\nand embody it,\nwe get robots.\nAnd robots are going to be bots,\nthey're going to be doing many\nof the tasks that we have already done.\nA job is just a bunch of tasks,\nso they're going to redefine our jobs\nbecause they're going to do\nsome of those tasks.\nBut they're also going to create\nwhole new categories,\na whole new slew of tasks\nthat we didn't know\nwe wanted to do before.\nThey're going to actually\nengender new kinds of jobs,\nnew kinds of tasks that we want done,\njust as automation made up\na whole bunch of new things\nthat we didn't know we needed before,\nand now we can't live without them.\nSo they're going to produce\neven more jobs than they take away,\nbut it's important that a lot of the tasks\nthat we're going to give them\nare tasks that can be defined\nin terms of efficiency or productivity.\nIf you can specify a task,\neither manual or conceptual,\nthat can be specified in terms\nof efficiency or productivity,\nthat goes to the bots.\nProductivity is for robots.\nWhat we're really good at\nis basically wasting time.\n\n\n\n11:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:16\n\n\nWe're really good at things\nthat are inefficient.\nScience is inherently inefficient.\nIt runs on that fact that you have\none failure after another.\nIt runs on the fact that you make tests\nand experiments that don't work,\notherwise you're not learning.\nIt runs on the fact\nthat there is not\na lot of efficiency in it.\nInnovation by definition is inefficient,\nbecause you make prototypes,\nbecause you try stuff that fails,\nthat doesn't work.\nExploration is inherently inefficiency.\nArt is not efficient.\nHuman relationships are not efficient.\nThese are all the kinds of things\nwe're going to gravitate to,\nbecause they're not efficient.\nEfficiency is for robots.\nWe're also going to learn\nthat we're going to work with these AIs\nbecause they think differently than us.\n\n\n\n12:01\n\n\nWhen Deep Blue beat\nthe world's best chess champion,\npeople thought it was the end of chess.\nBut actually, it turns out that today,\nthe best chess champion in the world\nis not an AI.\nAnd it's not a human.\nIt's the team of a human and an AI.\nThe best medical diagnostician\nis not a doctor, it's not an AI,\nit's the team.\nWe're going to be working with these AIs,\nand I think you'll be paid in the future\nby how well you work with these bots.\nSo that's the third thing,\nis that they're different,\nthey're utility\nand they are going to be something\nwe work with rather than against.\nWe're working with these\nrather than against them.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\nSo, the future:\nWhere does that take us?\nI think that 25 years from now,\nthey'll look back\nand look at our understanding\nof AI and say,\n\"You didn't have AI. In fact,\nyou didn't even have the Internet yet,\ncompared to what we're going\nto have 25 years from now.\"\nThere are no AI experts right now.\nThere's a lot of money going to it,\nthere are billions of dollars\nbeing spent on it;\nit's a huge business,\nbut there are no experts, compared\nto what we'll know 20 years from now.\nSo we are just at the beginning\nof the beginning,\nwe're in the first hour of all this.\nWe're in the first hour of the Internet.\nWe're in the first hour of what's coming.\nThe most popular AI product\nin 20 years from now,\nthat everybody uses,\nhas not been invented yet.\nThat means that you're not late.\n\n\n\n13:34\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n13:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:36\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhen I was six years old,\nI received my gifts.\nMy first grade teacher\nhad this brilliant idea.\nShe wanted us to experience\nreceiving gifts\nbut also learning the virtue\nof complimenting each other.\nSo she had all of us\ncome to the front of the classroom,\nand she bought all of us gifts\nand stacked them in the corner.\nAnd she said,\n\"Why don't we just stand here\nand compliment each other?\nIf you hear your name called,\ngo and pick up your gift and sit down.\"\nWhat a wonderful idea, right?\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n\n\n 0:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\nWell, there were 40 of us to start with,\nand every time I heard\nsomeone's name called,\nI would give out the heartiest cheer.\nAnd then there were 20 people left,\nand 10 people left,\nand five left ...\nand three left.\nAnd I was one of them.\nAnd the compliments stopped.\nWell, at that moment, I was crying.\nAnd the teacher was freaking out.\nShe was like, \"Hey, would anyone\nsay anything nice about these people?\"\n\n\n\n 1:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:16\n\n\n\"No one? OK, why don't you\ngo get your gift and sit down.\nSo behave next year —\nsomeone might say\nsomething nice about you.\"\n\n\n\n 1:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:25\n\n\nWell, as I'm describing this you,\nyou probably know\nI remember this really well.\n\n\n\n 1:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:31\n\n\nBut I don't know who felt worse that day.\nWas it me or the teacher?\nShe must have realized\nthat she turned a team-building event\ninto a public roast\nfor three six-year-olds.\nAnd without the humor.\nYou know, when you see\npeople get roasted on TV,\nit was funny.\nThere was nothing funny about that day.\n\n\n\n 1:50\n\n\nSo that was one version of me,\nand I would die to avoid\nbeing in that situation again —\nto get rejected in public again.\nThat's one version.\nThen fast-forward eight years.\nBill Gates came to my hometown —\nBeijing, China —\nto speak,\nand I saw his message.\nI fell in love with that guy.\nI thought, wow,\nI know what I want to do now.\nThat night I wrote a letter to my family\ntelling them: \"By age 25,\nI will build the biggest\ncompany in the world,\nand that company will buy Microsoft.\"\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:25\n\n\nI totally embraced this idea\nof conquering the world —\ndomination, right?\nAnd I didn't make this up,\nI did write that letter.\nAnd here it is —\n\n\n\n 2:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:36\n\n\nYou don't have to read this through —\n\n\n\n 2:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:40\n\n\nThis is also bad handwriting,\nbut I did highlight some key words.\nYou get the idea.\n\n\n\n 2:45\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nSo ...\nthat was another version of me:\none who will conquer the world.\n\n\n\n 2:54\n\n\nWell, then two years later,\nI was presented with the opportunity\nto come to the United States.\nI jumped on it,\nbecause that was\nwhere Bill Gates lived, right?\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:05\n\n\nI thought that was the start\nof my entrepreneur journey.\nThen, fast-forward another 14 years.\nI was 30.\nNope, I didn't build that company.\nI didn't even start.\nI was actually a marketing manager\nfor a Fortune 500 company.\nAnd I felt I was stuck;\nI was stagnant.\nWhy is that?\nWhere is that 14-year-old\nwho wrote that letter?\nIt's not because he didn't try.\nIt's because every time I had a new idea,\nevery time I wanted to try something new,\neven at work —\nI wanted to make a proposal,\nI wanted to speak up\nin front of people in a group —\nI felt there was this constant battle\nbetween the 14-year-old\nand the six-year-old.\nOne wanted to conquer the world —\nmake a difference —\nanother was afraid of rejection.\nAnd every time that six-year-old won.\n\n\n\n 3:56\n\n\nAnd this fear even persisted\nafter I started my own company.\nI mean, I started\nmy own company when I was 30 —\nif you want to be Bill Gates,\nyou've got to start\nsooner or later, right?\nWhen I was an entrepreneur,\nI was presented\nwith an investment opportunity,\nand then I was turned down.\nAnd that rejection hurt me.\nIt hurt me so bad\nthat I wanted to quit right there.\nBut then I thought,\nhey, would Bill Gates quit\nafter a simple investment rejection?\nWould any successful\nentrepreneur quit like that?\nNo way.\nAnd this is where it clicked for me.\nOK, I can build a better company.\nI can build a better\nteam or better product,\nbut one thing for sure:\nI've got to be a better leader.\nI've got to be a better person.\nI cannot let that six-year-old\nkeep dictating my life anymore.\nI have to put him back in his place.\n\n\n\n 4:50\n\n\nSo this is where I went online\nand looked for help.\nGoogle was my friend.\n\n\n\n 4:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:54\n\n\nI searched, \"How do I overcome\nthe fear of rejection?\"\nI came up with a bunch\nof psychology articles\nabout where the fear\nand pain are coming from.\nThen I came up with a bunch\nof \"rah-rah\" inspirational articles\nabout \"Don't take it personally,\njust overcome it.\"\nWho doesn't know that?\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:13\n\n\nBut why was I still so scared?\nThen I found this website by luck.\nIt's called rejectiontherapy.com.\n\n\n\n 5:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\n\"Rejection Therapy\" was this game\ninvented by this Canadian entrepreneur.\nHis name is Jason Comely.\nAnd basically the idea is for 30 days\nyou go out and look for rejection,\nand every day get rejected at something,\nand then by the end,\nyou desensitize yourself from the pain.\nAnd I loved that idea.\n\n\n\n 5:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\nI said, \"You know what?\nI'm going to do this.\nAnd I'll feel myself\ngetting rejected 100 days.\"\nAnd I came up with my own rejection ideas,\nand I made a video blog out of it.\n\n\n\n 5:54\n\n\nAnd so here's what I did.\nThis is what the blog looked like.\nDay One ...\n\n\n\n 6:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:02\n\n\nBorrow 100 dollars from a stranger.\nSo this is where I went\nto where I was working.\nI came downstairs\nand I saw this big guy\nsitting behind a desk.\nHe looked like a security guard.\nSo I just approached him.\nAnd I was just walking\nand that was the longest\nwalk of my life —\nhair on the back\nof my neck standing up,\nI was sweating and my heart was pounding.\nAnd I got there and said,\n\"Hey, sir, can I borrow\n100 dollars from you?\"\n\n\n\n 6:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\nAnd he looked up, he's like, \"No.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n 6:35\n\n\nAnd I just said, \"No? I'm sorry.\"\nThen I turned around,\nand I just ran.\n\n\n\n 6:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:41\n\n\nI felt so embarrassed.\nBut because I filmed myself —\nso that night I was watching\nmyself getting rejected,\nI just saw how scared I was.\nI looked like this kid\nin \"The Sixth Sense.\"\nI saw dead people.\n\n\n\n 6:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nBut then I saw this guy.\nYou know, he wasn't that menacing.\nHe was a chubby, loveable guy,\nand he even asked me, \"Why?\"\nIn fact, he invited me to explain myself.\nAnd I could've said many things.\nI could've explained,\nI could've negotiated.\nI didn't do any of that.\nAll I did was run.\nI felt, wow, this is like\na microcosm of my life.\nEvery time I felt the slightest rejection,\nI would just run as fast as I could.\nAnd you know what?\nThe next day, no matter what happens,\nI'm not going to run.\nI'll stay engaged.\n\n\n\n 7:31\n\n\nDay Two: Request a \"burger refill.\"\n\n\n\n 7:33\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:35\n\n\nIt's when I went to a burger joint,\nI finished lunch,\nand I went to the cashier and said,\n\"Hi, can I get a burger refill?\"\n\n\n\n 7:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:43\n\n\nHe was all confused,\nlike, \"What's a burger refill?\"\n\n\n\n 7:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:47\n\n\nI said, \"Well, it's just like\na drink refill but with a burger.\"\nAnd he said, \"Sorry,\nwe don't do burger refill, man.\"\n\n\n\n 7:53\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:55\n\n\nSo this is where rejection happened\nand I could have run, but I stayed.\nI said, \"Well, I love your burgers,\nI love your joint,\nand if you guys do a burger refill,\nI will love you guys more.\"\n\n\n\n 8:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:07\n\n\nAnd he said, \"Well, OK,\nI'll tell my manager about it,\nand maybe we'll do it,\nbut sorry, we can't do this today.\"\nThen I left.\nAnd by the way,\nI don't think they've\never done burger refill.\n\n\n\n 8:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nI think they're still there.\nBut the life and death feeling\nI was feeling the first time\nwas no longer there,\njust because I stayed engaged —\nbecause I didn't run.\nI said, \"Wow, great,\nI'm already learning things.\nGreat.\"\n\n\n\n 8:34\n\n\nAnd then Day Three:\nGetting Olympic Doughnuts.\nThis is where my life\nwas turned upside down.\nI went to a Krispy Kreme.\nIt's a doughnut shop\nin mainly the Southeastern part\nof the United States.\nI'm sure they have some here, too.\nAnd I went in,\nI said, \"Can you make me doughnuts\nthat look like Olympic symbols?\nBasically, you interlink\nfive doughnuts together ... \"\nI mean there's no way\nthey could say yes, right?\nThe doughnut maker took me so seriously.\n\n\n\n 9:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:02\n\n\nSo she put out paper,\nstarted jotting down\nthe colors and the rings,\nand is like, \"How can I make this?\"\nAnd then 15 minutes later,\nshe came out with a box\nthat looked like Olympic rings.\nAnd I was so touched.\nI just couldn't believe it.\nAnd that video got\nover five million views on Youtube.\nThe world couldn't believe that either.\n\n\n\n 9:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\nYou know, because of that\nI was in newspapers,\nin talk shows, in everything.\nAnd I became famous.\nA lot of people\nstarted writing emails to me\nand saying, \"What you're\ndoing is awesome.\"\nBut you know, fame and notoriety\ndid not do anything to me.\nWhat I really wanted to do was learn,\nand to change myself.\nSo I turned the rest\nof my 100 days of rejection\ninto this playground —\ninto this research project.\nI wanted to see what I could learn.\n\n\n\n 9:53\n\n\nAnd then I learned a lot of things.\nI discovered so many secrets.\nFor example, I found if I just don't run,\nif I got rejected,\nI could actually turn a \"no\" into a \"yes,\"\nand the magic word is, \"why.\"\n\n\n\n10:04\n\n\nSo one day I went to a stranger's house,\nI had this flower in my hand,\nknocked on the door and said,\n\"Hey, can I plant this flower\nin your backyard?\"\n\n\n\n10:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:13\n\n\nAnd he said, \"No.\"\nBut before he could leave I said,\n\"Hey, can I know why?\"\nAnd he said, \"Well, I have this dog\nthat would dig up\nanything I put in the backyard.\nI don't want to waste your flower.\nIf you want to do this,\ngo across the street and talk to Connie.\nShe loves flowers.\"\nSo that's what I did.\nI went across and knocked\non Connie's door.\nAnd she was so happy to see me.\n\n\n\n10:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:38\n\n\nAnd then half an hour later,\nthere was this flower\nin Connie's backyard.\nI'm sure it looks better now.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:45\n\n\nBut had I left\nafter the initial rejection,\nI would've thought,\nwell, it's because\nthe guy didn't trust me,\nit's because I was crazy,\nbecause I didn't dress up well,\nI didn't look good.\nIt was none of those.\nIt was because what I offered\ndid not fit what he wanted.\nAnd he trusted me enough\nto offer me a referral,\nusing a sales term.\nI converted a referral.\n\n\n\n11:05\n\n\nThen one day —\nand I also learned that I can\nactually say certain things\nand maximize my chance to get a yes.\nSo for example,\none day I went to a Starbucks,\nand asked the manager,\n\"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?\"\nHe was like, \"What's a Starbucks greeter?\"\nI said, \"Do you know\nthose Walmart greeters?\nYou know, those people who say\n'hi' to you before you walk in the store,\nand make sure you\ndon't steal stuff, basically?\nI want to give a Walmart experience\nto Starbucks customers.\"\n\n\n\n11:30\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:32\n\n\nWell, I'm not sure\nthat's a good thing, actually —\nActually, I'm pretty sure\nit's a bad thing.\nAnd he was like, \"Oh\" —\nyeah, this is how he looked,\nhis name is Eric —\nand he was like, \"I'm not sure.\"\nThis is how he was hearing me. \"Not sure.\"\nThen I ask him, \"Is that weird?\"\nHe's like, \"Yeah, it's really weird, man.\"\nBut as soon as he said that,\nhis whole demeanor changed.\nIt's as if he's putting\nall the doubt on the floor.\nAnd he said, \"Yeah, you can do this,\njust don't get too weird.\"\n\n\n\n12:00\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\nSo for the next hour\nI was the Starbucks greeter.\nI said \"hi\" to every customer\nthat walked in,\nand gave them holiday cheers.\nBy the way, I don't know\nwhat your career trajectory is,\ndon't be a greeter.\n\n\n\n12:13\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:14\n\n\nIt was really boring.\nBut then I found I could do this\nbecause I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\"\nI mentioned the doubt that he was having.\nAnd because I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\",\nthat means I wasn't weird.\nThat means I was actually\nthinking just like him,\nseeing this as a weird thing.\nAnd again, and again,\nI learned that if I mention\nsome doubt people might have\nbefore I ask the question,\nI gained their trust.\nPeople were more likely to say yes to me.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\nAnd then I learned\nI could fulfill my life dream ...\nby asking.\nYou know, I came\nfrom four generations of teachers,\nand my grandma has always told me,\n\"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,\nbut it'd be great\nif you became a teacher.\"\n\n\n\n12:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:58\n\n\nBut I wanted to be\nan entrepreneur, so I didn't.\nBut it has always been my dream\nto actually teach something.\nSo I said, \"What if I just ask\nand teach a college class?\"\nI lived in Austin at the time,\nso I went to University\nof Texas at Austin\nand knocked on professors' doors\nand said, \"Can I teach your class?\"\nI didn't get anywhere\nthe first couple of times.\nBut because I didn't run —\nI kept doing it —\nand on the third try\nthe professor was very impressed.\nHe was like, \"No one\nhas done this before.\"\nAnd I came in prepared\nwith powerpoints and my lesson.\nHe said, \"Wow, I can use this.\nWhy don't you come back in two months?\nI'll fit you in my curriculum.\"\nAnd two months later\nI was teaching a class.\n\n\n\n13:37\n\n\nThis is me — you probably can't see,\nthis is a bad picture.\nYou know, sometimes you get\nrejected by lighting, you know?\n\n\n\n13:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:45\n\n\nBut wow —\nwhen I finished teaching that class,\nI walked out crying,\nbecause I thought\nI could fulfill my life dream\njust by simply asking.\nI used to think I have to accomplish\nall these things —\nhave to be a great entrepreneur,\nor get a PhD to teach —\nbut no, I just asked,\nand I could teach.\n\n\n\n14:04\n\n\nAnd in that picture,\nwhich you can't see,\nI quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.\nWhy? Because in my research I found\nthat people who really change the world,\nwho change the way we live\nand the way we think,\nare the people who were met\nwith initial and often violent rejections.\nPeople like Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nlike Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,\nor even Jesus Christ.\nThese people did not\nlet rejection define them.\nThey let their own reaction\nafter rejection define themselves.\nAnd they embraced rejection.\n\n\n\n14:38\n\n\nAnd we don't have to be those people\nto learn about rejection,\nand in my case,\nrejection was my curse,\nwas my boogeyman.\nIt has bothered me my whole life\nbecause I was running away from it.\nThen I started embracing it.\nI turned that into\nthe biggest gift in my life.\nI started teaching people\nhow to turn rejections into opportunities.\nI use my blog, I use my talk,\nI use the book I just published,\nand I'm even building technology to help\npeople overcome their fear of rejection.\n\n\n\n15:11\n\n\nWhen you get rejected in life,\nwhen you are facing the next obstacle\nor next failure,\nconsider the possibilities.\nDon't run.\nIf you just embrace them,\nthey might become your gifts as well.\n\n\n\n15:24\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:25\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nFive years ago, I had my dream job.\nI was a foreign correspondent\nin the Middle East\nreporting for ABC News.\nBut there was a crack in the wall,\na problem with our industry,\nthat I felt we needed to fix.\nYou see, I got to the Middle East\nright around the end of 2007,\nwhich was just around the midpoint\nof the Iraq War.\nBut by the time I got there,\nit was already nearly impossible\nto find stories about Iraq on air.\nCoverage had dropped across the board,\nacross networks.\nAnd of the stories that did make it,\nmore than 80 percent\nof them were about us.\nWe were missing the stories about Iraq,\nthe people who live there,\nand what was happening to them\nunder the weight of the war.\n\n\n\n 1:00\n\n\nAfghanistan had already\nfallen off the agenda.\nThere were less than one percent\nof all news stories in 2008\nthat went to the war in Afghanistan.\nIt was the longest war in US history,\nbut information was so scarce\nthat schoolteachers we spoke to\ntold us they had trouble\nexplaining to their students\nwhat we were doing there,\nwhen those students had parents\nwho were fighting\nand sometimes dying overseas.\n\n\n\n 1:28\n\n\nWe had drawn a blank,\nand it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.\nFrom conflict zones to climate change\nto all sorts of issues\naround crises in public health,\nwe were missing what I call\nthe species-level issues,\nbecause as a species,\nthey could actually sink us.\nAnd by failing to understand\nthe complex issues of our time,\nwe were facing certain\npractical implications.\nHow were we going to solve problems\nthat we didn't fundamentally understand,\nthat we couldn't track in real time,\nand where the people working on the issues\nwere invisible to us\nand sometimes invisible to each other?\n\n\n\n 2:08\n\n\nWhen you look back on Iraq,\nthose years when we\nwere missing the story,\nwere the years when the society\nwas falling apart,\nwhen we were setting the conditions\nfor what would become the rise of ISIS,\nthe ISIS takeover of Mosul\nand terrorist violence that would spread\nbeyond Iraq's borders\nto the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n 2:28\n\n\nJust around that time\nwhere I was making that observation,\nI looked across the border of Iraq\nand noticed there was another\nstory we were missing:\nthe war in Syria.\nIf you were a Middle-East specialist,\nyou knew that Syria was that important\nfrom the start.\nBut it ended up being, really,\none of the forgotten stories\nof the Arab Spring.\nI saw the implications up front.\nSyria is intimately tied\nto regional security,\nto global stability.\nI felt like we couldn't let that become\nanother one of the stories we left behind.\n\n\n\n 3:03\n\n\nSo I left my big TV job to start\na website, called \"Syria Deeply.\"\nIt was designed to be a news\nand information source\nthat made it easier to understand\na complex issue,\nand for the past four years,\nit's been a resource\nfor policymakers and professionals\nworking on the conflict in Syria.\nWe built a business model\nbased on consistent,\nhigh-quality information,\nand convening the top minds on the issue.\nAnd we found it was a model that scaled.\nWe got passionate requests\nto do other things \"Deeply.\"\nSo we started to work our way\ndown the list.\n\n\n\n 3:42\n\n\nI'm just one of many entrepreneurs,\nand we are just one of many start-ups\ntrying to fix what's wrong with news.\nAll of us in the trenches know\nthat something is wrong\nwith the news industry.\nIt's broken.\nTrust in the media\nhas hit an all-time low.\nAnd the statistic you're seeing up there\nis from September —\nit's arguably gotten worse.\nBut we can fix this.\nWe can fix the news.\nI know that that's true.\nYou can call me an idealist;\nI call myself an industrious optimist.\nAnd I know there are\na lot of us out there.\nWe have ideas for how\nto make things better,\nand I want to share three of them\nthat we've picked up in our own work.\n\n\n\n 4:27\n\n\nIdea number one:\nwe need news that's built\non deep-domain knowledge.\nGiven the waves and waves of layoffs\nat newsrooms across the country,\nwe've lost the art of specialization.\nBeat reporting is an endangered thing.\nWhen it comes to foreign news,\nthe way we can fix that\nis by working with more local journalists,\ntreating them like our partners\nand collaborators,\nnot just fixers who fetch us\nphone numbers and sound bites.\nOur local reporters in Syria\nand across Africa and across Asia\nbring us stories that we certainly\nwould not have found on our own.\nLike this one from the suburbs\nof Damascus, about a wheelchair race\nthat gave hope\nto those wounded in the war.\nOr this one from Sierra Leone,\nabout a local chief\nwho curbed the spread of Ebola\nby self-organizing\na quarantine in his district.\nOr this one from the border of Pakistan,\nabout Afghan refugees being forced\nto return home before they are ready,\nunder the threat of police intimidation.\nOur local journalists are our mentors.\nThey teach us something new every day,\nand they bring us stories\nthat are important for all of us to know.\n\n\n\n 5:36\n\n\nIdea number two:\nwe need a kind of Hippocratic oath\nfor the news industry,\na pledge to first do no harm.\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 5:47\n\n\nJournalists need to be tough.\nWe need to speak truth to power,\nbut we also need to be responsible.\nWe need to live up to our own ideals,\nand we need to recognize\nwhen what we're doing\ncould potentially harm society,\nwhere we lose track of journalism\nas a public service.\n\n\n\n 6:05\n\n\nI watched us cover the Ebola crisis.\nWe launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.\nBut what we saw was a public\nthat was flooded with hysterical\nand sensational coverage,\nsometimes inaccurate,\nsometimes completely wrong.\nPublic health experts tell me\nthat that actually cost us in human lives,\nbecause by sparking more panic\nand by sometimes getting the facts wrong,\nwe made it harder for people to resolve\nwhat was actually happening on the ground.\nAll that noise made it harder\nto make the right decisions.\n\n\n\n 6:36\n\n\nWe can do better as an industry,\nbut it requires us recognizing\nhow we got it wrong last time,\nand deciding not to go that way next time.\nIt's a choice.\nWe have to resist the temptation\nto use fear for ratings.\nAnd that decision has to be made\nin the individual newsroom\nand with the individual news executive.\nBecause the next deadly virus\nthat comes around\ncould be much worse\nand the consequences much higher,\nif we do what we did last time;\nif our reporting isn't responsible\nand it isn't right.\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nThe third idea?\nWe need to embrace complexity\nif we want to make sense\nof a complex world.\nEmbrace complexity —\n\n\n\n 7:19\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 7:20\n\n\nnot treat the world simplistically,\nbecause simple isn't accurate.\nWe live in a complex world.\nNews is adult education.\nIt's our job as journalists\nto get elbow deep in complexity\nand to find new ways to make it easier\nfor everyone else to understand.\nIf we don't do that,\nif we pretend there are\njust simple answers,\nwe're leading everyone off a steep cliff.\nUnderstanding complexity\nis the only way to know the real threats\nthat are around the corner.\nIt's our responsibility\nto translate those threats\nand to help you understand what's real,\nso you can be prepared and know\nwhat it takes to be ready\nfor what comes next.\n\n\n\n 8:02\n\n\nI am an industrious optimist.\nI do believe we can fix what's broken.\nWe all want to.\nThere are great journalists\nout there doing great work —\nwe just need new formats.\nI honestly believe\nthis is a time of reawakening,\nreimagining what we can do.\nI believe we can fix what's broken.\nI know we can fix the news.\nI know it's worth trying,\nand I truly believe that in the end,\nwe're going to get this right.\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 8:30\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nThis is Lee Sedol.\nLee Sedol is one of the world's\ngreatest Go players,\nand he's having what my friends\nin Silicon Valley call\na \"Holy Cow\" moment —\n\n\n\n 0:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:22\n\n\na moment where we realize\nthat AI is actually progressing\na lot faster than we expected.\nSo humans have lost on the Go board.\nWhat about the real world?\n\n\n\n 0:32\n\n\nWell, the real world is much bigger,\nmuch more complicated than the Go board.\nIt's a lot less visible,\nbut it's still a decision problem.\nAnd if we think about some\nof the technologies\nthat are coming down the pike ...\nNoriko [Arai] mentioned that reading\nis not yet happening in machines,\nat least with understanding.\nBut that will happen,\nand when that happens,\nvery soon afterwards,\nmachines will have read everything\nthat the human race has ever written.\nAnd that will enable machines,\nalong with the ability to look\nfurther ahead than humans can,\nas we've already seen in Go,\nif they also have access\nto more information,\nthey'll be able to make better decisions\nin the real world than we can.\nSo is that a good thing?\nWell, I hope so.\n\n\n\n 1:25\n\n\nOur entire civilization,\neverything that we value,\nis based on our intelligence.\nAnd if we had access\nto a lot more intelligence,\nthen there's really no limit\nto what the human race can do.\nAnd I think this could be,\nas some people have described it,\nthe biggest event in human history.\nSo why are people saying things like this,\nthat AI might spell the end\nof the human race?\nIs this a new thing?\nIs it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates\nand Stephen Hawking?\n\n\n\n 2:00\n\n\nActually, no. This idea\nhas been around for a while.\nHere's a quotation:\n\"Even if we could keep the machines\nin a subservient position,\nfor instance, by turning off the power\nat strategic moments\" —\nand I'll come back to that\n\"turning off the power\" idea later on —\n\"we should, as a species,\nfeel greatly humbled.\"\nSo who said this?\nThis is Alan Turing in 1951.\nAlan Turing, as you know,\nis the father of computer science\nand in many ways,\nthe father of AI as well.\nSo if we think about this problem,\nthe problem of creating something\nmore intelligent than your own species,\nwe might call this \"the gorilla problem,\"\nbecause gorillas' ancestors did this\na few million years ago,\nand now we can ask the gorillas:\nWas this a good idea?\n\n\n\n 2:48\n\n\nSo here they are having a meeting\nto discuss whether it was a good idea,\nand after a little while,\nthey conclude, no,\nthis was a terrible idea.\nOur species is in dire straits.\nIn fact, you can see the existential\nsadness in their eyes.\n\n\n\n 3:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:05\n\n\nSo this queasy feeling that making\nsomething smarter than your own species\nis maybe not a good idea —\nwhat can we do about that?\nWell, really nothing,\nexcept stop doing AI,\nand because of all\nthe benefits that I mentioned\nand because I'm an AI researcher,\nI'm not having that.\nI actually want to be able\nto keep doing AI.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\nSo we actually need to nail down\nthe problem a bit more.\nWhat exactly is the problem?\nWhy is better AI possibly a catastrophe?\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nSo here's another quotation:\n\"We had better be quite sure\nthat the purpose put into the machine\nis the purpose which we really desire.\"\nThis was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960,\nshortly after he watched\none of the very early learning systems\nlearn to play checkers\nbetter than its creator.\nBut this could equally have been said\nby King Midas.\nKing Midas said, \"I want everything\nI touch to turn to gold,\"\nand he got exactly what he asked for.\nThat was the purpose\nthat he put into the machine,\nso to speak,\nand then his food and his drink\nand his relatives turned to gold\nand he died in misery and starvation.\nSo we'll call this\n\"the King Midas problem\"\nof stating an objective\nwhich is not, in fact,\ntruly aligned with what we want.\nIn modern terms, we call this\n\"the value alignment problem.\"\n\n\n\n 4:36\n\n\nPutting in the wrong objective\nis not the only part of the problem.\nThere's another part.\nIf you put an objective into a machine,\neven something as simple as,\n\"Fetch the coffee,\"\nthe machine says to itself,\n\"Well, how might I fail\nto fetch the coffee?\nSomeone might switch me off.\nOK, I have to take steps to prevent that.\nI will disable my 'off' switch.\nI will do anything to defend myself\nagainst interference\nwith this objective\nthat I have been given.\"\nSo this single-minded pursuit\nin a very defensive mode\nof an objective that is, in fact,\nnot aligned with the true objectives\nof the human race —\nthat's the problem that we face.\nAnd in fact, that's the high-value\ntakeaway from this talk.\nIf you want to remember one thing,\nit's that you can't fetch\nthe coffee if you're dead.\n\n\n\n 5:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nIt's very simple. Just remember that.\nRepeat it to yourself three times a day.\n\n\n\n 5:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:34\n\n\nAnd in fact, this is exactly the plot\nof \"2001: [A Space Odyssey]\"\nHAL has an objective, a mission,\nwhich is not aligned\nwith the objectives of the humans,\nand that leads to this conflict.\nNow fortunately, HAL\nis not superintelligent.\nHe's pretty smart,\nbut eventually Dave outwits him\nand manages to switch him off.\nBut we might not be so lucky.\nSo what are we going to do?\n\n\n\n 6:11\n\n\nI'm trying to redefine AI\nto get away from this classical notion\nof machines that intelligently\npursue objectives.\nThere are three principles involved.\nThe first one is a principle\nof altruism, if you like,\nthat the robot's only objective\nis to maximize the realization\nof human objectives,\nof human values.\nAnd by values here I don't mean\ntouchy-feely, goody-goody values.\nI just mean whatever it is\nthat the human would prefer\ntheir life to be like.\nAnd so this actually violates Asimov's law\nthat the robot has to protect\nits own existence.\nIt has no interest in preserving\nits existence whatsoever.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nThe second law is a law\nof humility, if you like.\nAnd this turns out to be really\nimportant to make robots safe.\nIt says that the robot does not know\nwhat those human values are,\nso it has to maximize them,\nbut it doesn't know what they are.\nAnd that avoids this problem\nof single-minded pursuit\nof an objective.\nThis uncertainty turns out to be crucial.\n\n\n\n 7:20\n\n\nNow, in order to be useful to us,\nit has to have some idea of what we want.\nIt obtains that information primarily\nby observation of human choices,\nso our own choices reveal information\nabout what it is that we prefer\nour lives to be like.\nSo those are the three principles.\nLet's see how that applies\nto this question of:\n\"Can you switch the machine off?\"\nas Turing suggested.\n\n\n\n 7:48\n\n\nSo here's a PR2 robot.\nThis is one that we have in our lab,\nand it has a big red \"off\" switch\nright on the back.\nThe question is: Is it\ngoing to let you switch it off?\nIf we do it the classical way,\nwe give it the objective of, \"Fetch\nthe coffee, I must fetch the coffee,\nI can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,\"\nso obviously the PR2\nhas been listening to my talk,\nand so it says, therefore,\n\"I must disable my 'off' switch,\nand probably taser all the other\npeople in Starbucks\nwho might interfere with me.\"\n\n\n\n 8:18\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nSo this seems to be inevitable, right?\nThis kind of failure mode\nseems to be inevitable,\nand it follows from having\na concrete, definite objective.\n\n\n\n 8:29\n\n\nSo what happens if the machine\nis uncertain about the objective?\nWell, it reasons in a different way.\nIt says, \"OK, the human\nmight switch me off,\nbut only if I'm doing something wrong.\nWell, I don't really know what wrong is,\nbut I know that I don't want to do it.\"\nSo that's the first and second\nprinciples right there.\n\"So I should let the human switch me off.\"\nAnd in fact you can calculate\nthe incentive that the robot has\nto allow the human to switch it off,\nand it's directly tied to the degree\nof uncertainty about\nthe underlying objective.\n\n\n\n 9:04\n\n\nAnd then when the machine is switched off,\nthat third principle comes into play.\nIt learns something about the objectives\nit should be pursuing,\nbecause it learns that\nwhat it did wasn't right.\nIn fact, we can, with suitable use\nof Greek symbols,\nas mathematicians usually do,\nwe can actually prove a theorem\nthat says that such a robot\nis provably beneficial to the human.\nYou are provably better off\nwith a machine that's designed in this way\nthan without it.\nSo this is a very simple example,\nbut this is the first step\nin what we're trying to do\nwith human-compatible AI.\n\n\n\n 9:41\n\n\nNow, this third principle,\nI think is the one that you're probably\nscratching your head over.\nYou're probably thinking, \"Well,\nyou know, I behave badly.\nI don't want my robot to behave like me.\nI sneak down in the middle of the night\nand take stuff from the fridge.\nI do this and that.\"\nThere's all kinds of things\nyou don't want the robot doing.\nBut in fact, it doesn't\nquite work that way.\nJust because you behave badly\ndoesn't mean the robot\nis going to copy your behavior.\nIt's going to understand your motivations\nand maybe help you resist them,\nif appropriate.\nBut it's still difficult.\nWhat we're trying to do, in fact,\nis to allow machines to predict\nfor any person and for any possible life\nthat they could live,\nand the lives of everybody else:\nWhich would they prefer?\nAnd there are many, many\ndifficulties involved in doing this;\nI don't expect that this\nis going to get solved very quickly.\nThe real difficulties, in fact, are us.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\n\nAs I have already mentioned,\nwe behave badly.\nIn fact, some of us are downright nasty.\nNow the robot, as I said,\ndoesn't have to copy the behavior.\nThe robot does not have\nany objective of its own.\nIt's purely altruistic.\nAnd it's not designed just to satisfy\nthe desires of one person, the user,\nbut in fact it has to respect\nthe preferences of everybody.\nSo it can deal with a certain\namount of nastiness,\nand it can even understand\nthat your nastiness, for example,\nyou may take bribes as a passport official\nbecause you need to feed your family\nand send your kids to school.\nIt can understand that;\nit doesn't mean it's going to steal.\nIn fact, it'll just help you\nsend your kids to school.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nWe are also computationally limited.\nLee Sedol is a brilliant Go player,\nbut he still lost.\nSo if we look at his actions,\nhe took an action that lost the game.\nThat doesn't mean he wanted to lose.\nSo to understand his behavior,\nwe actually have to invert\nthrough a model of human cognition\nthat includes our computational\nlimitations — a very complicated model.\nBut it's still something\nthat we can work on understanding.\n\n\n\n11:56\n\n\nProbably the most difficult part,\nfrom my point of view as an AI researcher,\nis the fact that there are lots of us,\nand so the machine has to somehow\ntrade off, weigh up the preferences\nof many different people,\nand there are different ways to do that.\nEconomists, sociologists,\nmoral philosophers have understood that,\nand we are actively\nlooking for collaboration.\n\n\n\n12:19\n\n\nLet's have a look and see what happens\nwhen you get that wrong.\nSo you can have\na conversation, for example,\nwith your intelligent personal assistant\nthat might be available\nin a few years' time.\nThink of a Siri on steroids.\nSo Siri says, \"Your wife called\nto remind you about dinner tonight.\"\nAnd of course, you've forgotten.\n\"What? What dinner?\nWhat are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\n\"Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm.\"\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\n\"I can't do that. I'm meeting\nwith the secretary-general at 7:30.\nHow could this have happened?\"\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\n\"Well, I did warn you, but you overrode\nmy recommendation.\"\n\n\n\n12:59\n\n\n\"Well, what am I going to do?\nI can't just tell him I'm too busy.\"\n\n\n\n13:03\n\n\n\"Don't worry. I arranged\nfor his plane to be delayed.\"\n\n\n\n13:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:09\n\n\n\"Some kind of computer malfunction.\"\n\n\n\n13:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\n\"Really? You can do that?\"\n\n\n\n13:15\n\n\n\"He sends his profound apologies\nand looks forward to meeting you\nfor lunch tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n13:20\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:21\n\n\nSo the values here —\nthere's a slight mistake going on.\nThis is clearly following my wife's values\nwhich is \"Happy wife, happy life.\"\n\n\n\n13:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:32\n\n\nIt could go the other way.\nYou could come home\nafter a hard day's work,\nand the computer says, \"Long day?\"\n\n\n\n13:39\n\n\n\"Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch.\"\n\n\n\n13:41\n\n\n\"You must be very hungry.\"\n\n\n\n13:42\n\n\n\"Starving, yeah.\nCould you make some dinner?\"\n\n\n\n13:47\n\n\n\"There's something I need to tell you.\"\n\n\n\n13:49\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:51\n\n\n\"There are humans in South Sudan\nwho are in more urgent need than you.\"\n\n\n\n13:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\n\"So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner.\"\n\n\n\n13:59\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:01\n\n\nSo we have to solve these problems,\nand I'm looking forward\nto working on them.\n\n\n\n14:06\n\n\nThere are reasons for optimism.\nOne reason is,\nthere is a massive amount of data.\nBecause remember — I said\nthey're going to read everything\nthe human race has ever written.\nMost of what we write about\nis human beings doing things\nand other people getting upset about it.\nSo there's a massive amount\nof data to learn from.\n\n\n\n14:22\n\n\nThere's also a very\nstrong economic incentive\nto get this right.\nSo imagine your domestic robot's at home.\nYou're late from work again\nand the robot has to feed the kids,\nand the kids are hungry\nand there's nothing in the fridge.\nAnd the robot sees the cat.\n\n\n\n14:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:39\n\n\nAnd the robot hasn't quite learned\nthe human value function properly,\nso it doesn't understand\nthe sentimental value of the cat outweighs\nthe nutritional value of the cat.\n\n\n\n14:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:51\n\n\nSo then what happens?\nWell, it happens like this:\n\"Deranged robot cooks kitty\nfor family dinner.\"\nThat one incident would be the end\nof the domestic robot industry.\nSo there's a huge incentive\nto get this right\nlong before we reach\nsuperintelligent machines.\n\n\n\n15:11\n\n\nSo to summarize:\nI'm actually trying to change\nthe definition of AI\nso that we have provably\nbeneficial machines.\nAnd the principles are:\nmachines that are altruistic,\nthat want to achieve only our objectives,\nbut that are uncertain\nabout what those objectives are,\nand will watch all of us\nto learn more about what it is\nthat we really want.\nAnd hopefully in the process,\nwe will learn to be better people.\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n15:38\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:41\n\n\nChris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart.\nWe're going to stand here a bit\nbecause I think they're setting up\nfor our next speaker.\n\n\n\n15:48\n\n\nA couple of questions.\nSo the idea of programming in ignorance\nseems intuitively really powerful.\nAs you get to superintelligence,\nwhat's going to stop a robot\nreading literature and discovering\nthis idea that knowledge\nis actually better than ignorance\nand still just shifting its own goals\nand rewriting that programming?\n\n\n\n16:08\n\n\nStuart Russell: Yes, so we want\nit to learn more, as I said,\nabout our objectives.\nIt'll only become more certain\nas it becomes more correct,\nso the evidence is there\nand it's going to be designed\nto interpret it correctly.\nIt will understand, for example,\nthat books are very biased\nin the evidence they contain.\nThey only talk about kings and princes\nand elite white male people doing stuff.\nSo it's a complicated problem,\nbut as it learns more about our objectives\nit will become more and more useful to us.\n\n\n\n16:45\n\n\nCA: And you couldn't\njust boil it down to one law,\nyou know, hardwired in:\n\"if any human ever tries to switch me off,\nI comply. I comply.\"\n\n\n\n16:54\n\n\nSR: Absolutely not.\nThat would be a terrible idea.\nSo imagine that you have\na self-driving car\nand you want to send your five-year-old\noff to preschool.\nDo you want your five-year-old\nto be able to switch off the car\nwhile it's driving along?\nProbably not.\nSo it needs to understand how rational\nand sensible the person is.\nThe more rational the person,\nthe more willing you are\nto be switched off.\nIf the person is completely\nrandom or even malicious,\nthen you're less willing\nto be switched off.\n\n\n\n17:23\n\n\nCA: All right. Stuart, can I just say,\nI really, really hope you\nfigure this out for us.\nThank you so much for that talk.\nThat was amazing.\n\n\n\n17:29\n\n\nSR: Thank you.\n\n\n\n17:31\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

Just kidding.\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:28\n\n\nOk, so why is the problem accelerating?\nAnd part of the problem is, ironically,\nbecause the industry\nhas put so much thought\ninto making things easier to use.\nI'll show you what I mean.\nThis is what the computer\ninterface used to look like, DOS.\nOver the years, it's gotten easier to use.\nThis is the original Mac operating system.\nReagan was President.\nMadonna was still a brunette.\nAnd the entire operating system —\nthis is the good part — the entire\noperating system fit in 211 k.\nYou couldn't put\nthe Mac OS X logo in 211 k!\n\n\n\n 4:02\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:03\n\n\nSo the irony is, that as these\nthings became easier to use,\na less technical, broader audience\nwas coming into contact\nwith this equipment for the first time.\n\n\n\n 4:13\n\n\nI once had the distinct privilege\nof sitting in on the Apple call center\nfor a day.\nThe guy had a duplicate headset\nfor me to listen to.\nAnd the calls that —\nyou know how they say,\n\"Your call may be recorded\nfor quality assurance?\"\nUh-uh.\nYour call may be recorded\nso that they can collect\nthe funniest dumb user stories\nand pass them around on a CD.\n\n\n\n 4:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nWhich they do.\n\n\n\n 4:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:40\n\n\nAnd I have a copy.\n\n\n\n 4:41\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nIt's in your gift bag. No, no.\nWith your voices on it!\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\nSo, some of the stories are just\nso classic, and yet so understandable.\nA woman called Apple to complain\nthat her mouse was squeaking.\nMaking a squeaking noise.\nAnd the technician said,\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\n\"Well, ma'am, what do you mean\nyour mouse is squeaking?\"\n\n\n\n 5:00\n\n\nShe says, \"All I can tell you\nis that it squeaks louder,\nthe faster I move it across the screen.\"\n\n\n\n 5:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:08\n\n\nAnd the technician's like,\n\"Ma'am, you've got the mouse\nup against the screen?\"\n\n\n\n 5:12\n\n\nShe goes, \"Well, the message said,\n'Click here to continue.'\"\n\n\n\n 5:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:18\n\n\nWell, if you like that one —\nhow much time have we got?\nAnother one, a guy called —\nthis is absolutely true —\nhis computer had crashed,\nand he told the technician\nhe couldn't restart it, no matter\nhow many times he typed \"11.\"\nAnd the technician said,\n\"What? Why are you typing 11?\"\nHe said, \"The message says,\n'Error Type 11.'\"\n\n\n\n 5:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:43\n\n\nSo, we must admit\nthat some of the blame falls squarely\nat the feet of the users.\nBut why is the technical overload crisis,\nthe complexity crisis, accelerating now?\n\n\n\n 5:56\n\n\nIn the hardware world, it's because\nwe the consumers want\neverything to be smaller,\nsmaller, smaller.\nSo the gadgets are getting\ntinier and tinier,\nbut our fingers are essentially\nstaying the same size.\nSo it gets to be more and more\nof a challenge.\nSoftware is subject\nto another primal force:\nthe mandate to release\nmore and more versions.\nWhen you buy a piece of software,\nit's not like buying a vase\nor a candy bar, where you own it.\nIt's more like joining a club,\nwhere you pay dues every year,\nand every year, they say,\n\"We've added more features,\nand we'll sell it to you for $99.\"\nI know one guy who's spent $4,000\njust on Photoshop over the years.\nAnd software companies make\n35 percent of their revenue\nfrom just these software upgrades.\nI call it the Software Upgrade Paradox —\nwhich is that if you improve\na piece of software enough times,\nyou eventually ruin it.\n\n\n\n 6:44\n\n\nI mean, Microsoft Word was last\njust a word processor in, you know,\nthe Eisenhower administration.\n\n\n\n 6:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:51\n\n\nBut what's the alternative?\nMicrosoft actually did this experiment.\nThey said, \"Well, wait a minute.\nEveryone complains that\nwe're adding so many features.\nLet's create a word processor\nthat's just a word processor:\nSimple, pure; does not do web pages,\nis not a database.\"\nAnd it came out,\nand it was called Microsoft Write.\nAnd none of you are nodding\nin acknowledgment, because it died.\nIt tanked. No one ever bought it.\nI call this the Sport Utility Principle.\nPeople like to surround themselves\nwith unnecessary power, right?\nThey don't need the database\nand the website, but they're like,\n\"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might,\nyou know, I might need that someday.\"\nSo the problem is: as you add more\nfeatures, where are they going to go?\nWhere are you going to stick them?\nYou only have so many design tools.\nYou can do buttons, you can do\nsliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.\nBut if you're not careful\nabout how you choose,\nyou wind up with this.\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:45\n\n\nThis is an un-retouched —\nthis is not a joke —\nun-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,\nthe copy that you have,\nwith all the toolbars open.\nYou've obviously never\nopened all the toolbars,\nbut all you have to type in\nis this little, teeny window down here.\n\n\n\n 8:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:04\n\n\nAnd we've arrived at the age\nof interface matrices,\nwhere there are so many\nfeatures and options,\nyou have to do two dimensions, you know:\na vertical and a horizontal.\nYou guys all complain\nabout how Microsoft Word\nis always bulleting your lists\nand underlining your links automatically.\nThe off switch is in there somewhere.\nI'm telling you — it's there.\nPart of the art of designing\na simple, good interface,\nis knowing when to use\nwhich one of these features.\nSo, here is the log-off\ndialogue box for Windows 2000.\nThere are only four choices,\nso why are they in a pop-up menu?\nIt's not like the rest of the screen\nis so full of other components\nthat you need to collapse the choices.\nThey could have put them all out in view.\n\n\n\n 8:48\n\n\nHere's Apple's take\non the exact same dialogue box.\n\n\n\n 8:51\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:52\n\n\nThank you — yes, I designed\nthe dialogue box. No, no.\nAlready, we can see\nthat Apple and Microsoft\nhave a severely divergent\napproach to software design.\nMicrosoft's approach\nto simplicity tends to be:\nlet's break it down;\nlet's just make it more steps.\nThere are these \"wizards\" everywhere.\nAnd you know, there's a new version\nof Windows coming out this fall.\nIf they continue at this pace,\nthere's absolutely no telling\nwhere they might wind up.\n\n\n\n 9:19\n\n\n[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:23\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\n\"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.\"\nOk, I'll bite.\nLet's click \"Next\" to continue.\n\n\n\n 9:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:34\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:36\n\n\nFrom the drop-down menu, choose\nthe first letter you want to type. Ok.\n\n\n\n 9:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:41\n\n\nSo there is a limit\nthat we don't want to cross.\nSo what is the answer?\nHow do you pack in all these features\nin a simple, intelligent way?\nI believe in consistency, when possible,\nreal-world equivalents,\ntrash can folder, when possible,\nlabel things, mostly.\nBut I beg of the designers here\nto break all those rules\nif they violate the biggest rule of all,\nwhich is intelligence.\nNow what do I mean by that?\nI'm going to give you some examples\nwhere intelligence makes something\nnot consistent, but it's better.\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\nIf you are buying something on the web,\nyou're supposed to put in your address,\nand you're supposed to choose\nwhat country you're from, ok?\nThere are 200 countries in the world.\nWe like to think of the Internet\nas a global village.\nI'm sorry; it's not one yet.\nIt's mainly like, the United States,\nEurope, and Japan.\nSo why is \"United States\" in the \"U\"s?\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:29\n\n\nYou have to scroll, like,\nseven screensful to get to it.\nNow, it would be inconsistent\nto put \"United States\" first,\nbut it would be intelligent.\n\n\n\n10:37\n\n\nThis one's been touched on before,\nbut why in God's name do you\nshut down a Windows PC\nby clicking a button called \"Start?\"\n\n\n\n10:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:50\n\n\nHere's another pet one of mine:\nyou have a printer.\nMost of the time, you want to print\none copy of your document,\nin page order, on that printer.\nSo why in God's name do you see\nthis every time you print?\nIt's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.\n\n\n\n11:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:08\n\n\nAnd one of the buttons at the bottom,\nyou'll notice, is not \"Print.\"\n\n\n\n11:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:17\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n11:20\n\n\nNow, I'm not saying that Apple\nis the only company who has embraced\nthe cult of simplicity.\nPalm is also, especially in the old days,\nwonderful about this.\nI actually got to speak to Palm\nwhen they were flying high in the '90s,\nand after the talk,\nI met one of the employees.\nHe says, \"Nice talk.\" And I said,\n\"Thank you. What do you do here?\"\nHe said, \"I'm a tap counter.\"\nI'm like, \"You're a what?\"\nHe goes, \"Well Jeff Hawkins,\nthe CEO, says,\n'If any task on the Palm Pilot\ntakes more than three taps of the stylus,\nit's too long,\nand it has to be redesigned.'\nSo I'm the tap counter.\"\nSo, I'm going to show you an example\nof a company that does not\nhave a tap counter.\n\n\n\n11:56\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n11:58\n\n\nThis is Microsoft Word.\nOk, when you want to create\na new blank document in Word —\nit could happen.\n\n\n\n12:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:10\n\n\nYou go up to the \"File\" menu\nand you choose \"New.\"\nNow, what happens when you choose \"New?\"\nDo you get a new blank document?\nYou do not.\nOn the opposite side of the monitor,\na task bar appears,\nand somewhere in those links —\nby the way, not at the top —\nsomewhere in those links is a button\nthat makes you a new document.\nOk, so that is a company\nnot counting taps.\nYou know, I don't want to just stand\nhere and make fun of Microsoft ...\nYes, I do.\n\n\n\n12:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n12:42\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:45\n\n\nThe Bill Gates song!\n\n\n\n12:47\n\n\n(Piano music)\n\n\n\n12:48\n\n\nI've been a geek forever\nand I wrote the very first DOS.\nI put my software and IBM together;\nI got profit and they got the loss.\n\n\n\n13:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:05\n\n\nI write the code\nthat makes the whole world run.\nI'm getting royalties from everyone.\nSometimes it's garbage,\nbut the press is snowed.\nYou buy the box; I'll sell the code.\nEvery software company\nis doing Microsoft's R&D.\nYou can't keep a good idea\ndown these days.\nEven Windows is a hack.\nWe're kind of based loosely on the Mac.\nSo it's big, so it's slow.\nYou've got nowhere to go.\nI'm not doing this for praise.\nI write the code\nthat fits the world today.\nBig mediocrity in every way.\nWe've entered planet domination mode.\nYou'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.\nI am Bill Gates and I write the code.\n\n\n\n14:11\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n14:19\n\n\nBut actually, I believe\nthere are really two Microsofts.\nThere's the old one, responsible\nfor Windows and Office.\nThey're dying to throw the whole thing\nout and start fresh, but they can't.\nThey're locked in, because so many add-ons\nand other company stuff\nlocks into the old 1982 chassis.\nBut there's also a new Microsoft,\nthat's really doing good,\nsimple interface designs.\nI liked the Media Center PC.\nI liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.\nThe Wireless Watch\nflopped miserably in the market,\nbut it wasn't because it wasn't\nsimply and beautifully designed.\nBut let's put it this way:\nwould you pay $10 a month to have a watch\nthat has to be recharged\nevery night like your cell phone,\nand stops working\nwhen you leave your area code?\n\n\n\n14:59\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:02\n\n\nSo, the signs might indicate\nthat the complexity crunch\nis only going to get worse.\nSo is there any hope?\nThe screens are getting smaller,\npeople are illuminating,\nputting manuals in the boxes,\nthings are coming out at a faster pace.\nIt's funny — when Steve Jobs\ncame back to Apple in 1997,\nafter 12 years away,\nit was the MacWorld Expo —\nhe came to the stage\nin that black turtleneck and jeans,\nand he sort of did this.\nThe crowd went wild,\nbut I had just seen —\nI'm like, where have I seen this before?\nI had just seen the movie \"Evita\" —\n\n\n\n15:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:35\n\n\nwith Madonna,\nand I'm like, you know what?\nI've got to do one about Steve Jobs.\n\n\n\n15:41\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n15:42\n\n\nIt won't be easy.\nYou'll think I'm strange.\n\n\n\n15:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:47\n\n\nWhen I try to explain why I'm back,\nafter telling the press\nApple's future is black.\nYou won't believe me.\nAll that you see is a kid in his teens\nwho started out in a garage\nwith only a buddy named Woz.\n\n\n\n16:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:04\n\n\nYou try rhyming with garage!\n\n\n\n16:06\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:08\n\n\nDon't cry for me, Cupertino.\n\n\n\n16:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:13\n\n\nThe truth is, I never left you.\nI know the ropes now,\nknow what the tricks are.\nI made a fortune over at Pixar.\n\n\n\n16:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:24\n\n\nDon't cry for me, Cupertino.\nI've still got the drive and vision.\nI still wear sandals in any weather.\nIt's just that these days,\nthey're Gucci leather.\n\n\n\n16:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n16:40\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n16:47\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n16:48\n\n\nSo Steve Jobs had always believed\nin simplicity and elegance and beauty.\nAnd the truth is,\nfor years I was a little depressed,\nbecause Americans\nobviously did not value it,\nbecause the Mac had\nthree percent market share,\nWindows had 95 percent market share —\npeople did not think it was worth\nputting a price on it.\nSo I was a little depressed.\nAnd then I heard Al Gore's talk,\nand I realized I didn't know\nthe meaning of depressed.\n\n\n\n17:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n17:14\n\n\nBut it turns out I was wrong, right?\nBecause the iPod came out,\nand it violated every bit\nof common wisdom.\nOther products cost less;\nother products had more features,\nthey had voice recorders\nand FM transmitters.\nThe other products were backed\nby Microsoft, with an open standard,\nnot Apple's propriety standard.\nBut the iPod won —\nthis is the one they wanted.\nThe lesson was: simplicity sells.\nAnd there are signs that the industry\nis getting the message.\nThis is a little company that's done\nvery well with simplicity and elegance.\nThe Sonos thing — it's catching on.\n\n\n\n17:44\n\n\nI've got just a couple examples.\nPhysically, a really cool,\nelegant thinking coming along lately.\nWhen you have a digital camera,\nhow do you get the pictures\nback to your computer?\nWell, you either haul around a USB cable,\nor you buy a card reader\nand haul that around.\nEither one, you're going to lose.\nWhat I do is, I take out the memory card,\nand I fold it in half,\nrevealing USB contacts.\nI just stick it in the computer,\noffload the pictures,\nput it right back in the camera.\nI never have to lose anything.\nHere's another example.\nChris, you're the source of all power.\nWill you be my power plug?\n\n\n\n18:19\n\n\nChris Anderson: Oh yeah.\nDP: Hold that and don't let go.\nYou might've seen this,\nthis is Apple's new laptop.\nThis the power cord.\nIt hooks on like this.\nAnd I'm sure every one of you has done\nthis at some point in your lives,\nor one of your children.\nYou walk along — and I'm\nabout to pull this onto the floor.\nI don't care. It's a loaner.\nHere we go. Whoa!\nIt's magnetic — it doesn't pull\nthe laptop onto the floor.\n\n\n\n18:39\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n18:44\n\n\nIn my very last example —\nI do a lot of my work\nusing speech recognition software.\nAnd I'll just —\nyou have to be kind of quiet\nbecause the software is nervous.\nSpeech recognition\nsoftware is really great\nfor doing emails very quickly; period.\nLike, I get hundreds of them\na day; period.\nAnd it's not just what I dictate\nthat it writes down; period.\nI also use this feature\ncalled voice macros; period.\nCorrect \"dissuade.\"\nNot \"just.\"\nOk, this is not an ideal situation,\nbecause it's getting the echo\nfrom the hall and stuff.\nThe point is, I can respond to people\nvery quickly by saying a short word,\nand having it write out\na much longer thing.\nSo if somebody\nsends me a fan letter, I'll say,\n\"Thanks for that.\"\n\n\n\n19:32\n\n\n[Thank you so much\nfor taking the time to write ...]\n\n\n\n19:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:36\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n19:39\n\n\nAnd conversely, if somebody\nsends me hate mail —\nwhich happens daily —\nI say, \"Piss off.\"\n\n\n\n19:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:51\n\n\n[I admire your frankness ...]\n\n\n\n19:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n19:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n20:01\n\n\nSo that's my dirty little secret.\nDon't tell anyone.\n\n\n\n20:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n20:05\n\n\nSo the point is —\nthis is a really interesting story.\nThis is version eight of this software,\nand do you know what they put\nin version eight?\nNo new features. It's never\nhappened before in software!\nThe company put no new features.\nThey just said, \"We'll make\nthis software work right.\" Right?\nBecause for years, people had bought\nthis software, tried it out —\n95 percent accuracy was all they got,\nwhich means one in 20 words is wrong —\nand they'd put it in their drawer.\nAnd the company got sick of that,\nso they said, \"This version,\nwe're not going to do anything,\nbut make sure it's darned accurate.\"\nAnd so that's what they did.\n\n\n\n20:36\n\n\nThis cult of doing things right\nis starting to spread.\nSo, my final advice for those of you\nwho are consumers of this technology:\nremember, if it doesn't work,\nit's not necessarily you, ok?\nIt could be the design\nof the thing you're using.\nBe aware in life\nof good design and bad design.\nAnd if you're among the people\nwho create this stuff:\nEasy is hard.\nPre-sweat the details for your audience.\nCount the taps.\nRemember, the hard part\nis not deciding what features to add,\nit's deciding what to leave out.\nAnd best of all, your motivation is:\nsimplicity sells.\n\n\n\n21:08\n\n\nCA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n21:10\n\n\nCA: Hear, hear!\n\n\n\n21:11\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nI was 14 years old\ninside of a bowling alley,\nburglarizing an arcade game,\nand upon exiting the building\na security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.\nI ran down the street,\nand I jumped on top of a fence.\nAnd when I got to the top,\nthe weight of 3,000 quarters\nin my book bag\npulled me back down to the ground.\nSo when I came to, the security guard\nwas standing on top of me,\nand he said, \"Next time you little punks\nsteal something you can carry.\"\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\nI was taken to juvenile hall\nand when I was released\ninto the custody of my mother,\nthe first words my uncle said was,\n\"How'd you get caught?\"\nI said, \"Man, the book bag was too heavy.\"\nHe said, \"Man, you weren't supposed\nto take all the quarters.\"\nI said, \"Man, they were small.\nWhat am I supposed to do?\"\nAnd 10 minutes later, he took me\nto burglarize another arcade game.\nWe needed gas money to get home.\nThat was my life.\n\n\n\n 1:06\n\n\nI grew up in Oakland, California,\nwith my mother and members\nof my immediate family\naddicted to crack cocaine.\nMy environment consisted\nof living with family, friends,\nand homeless shelters.\nOftentimes, dinner was served\nin breadlines and soup kitchens.\nThe big homey told me this:\nmoney rules the world\nand everything in it.\nAnd in these streets, money is king.\nAnd if you follow the money,\nit'll lead you to the bad guy\nor the good guy.\n\n\n\n 1:37\n\n\nSoon after, I committed my first crime,\nand it was the first time\nthat I was told that I had potential\nand felt like somebody believed in me.\nNobody ever told me\nthat I could be a lawyer,\ndoctor or engineer.\nI mean, how was I supposed to do that?\nI couldn't read, write or spell.\nI was illiterate.\nSo I always thought\ncrime was my way to go.\n\n\n\n 1:58\n\n\nAnd then one day\nI was talking to somebody\nand he was telling me\nabout this robbery that we could do.\nAnd we did it.\n\n\n\n 2:08\n\n\nThe reality was that I was growing up\nin the strongest\nfinancial nation in the world,\nthe United States of America,\nwhile I watched my mother\nstand in line at a blood bank\nto sell her blood for 40 dollars\njust to try to feed her kids.\nShe still has the needle marks\non her arms to day to show for that.\n\n\n\n 2:28\n\n\nSo I never cared about my community.\nThey didn't care about my life.\nEverybody there was doing what they\nwere doing to take what they wanted,\nthe drug dealers,\nthe robbers, the blood bank.\nEverybody was taking blood money.\nSo I got mine by any means necessary.\nI got mine.\nFinancial literacy\nreally did rule the world,\nand I was a child slave to it\nfollowing the bad guy.\n\n\n\n 2:51\n\n\nAt 17 years old, I was arrested\nfor robbery and murder\nand I soon learned that finances in prison\nrule more than they did on the streets,\nso I wanted in.\nOne day, I rushed to grab\nthe sports page of the newspaper\nso my cellie could read it to me,\nand I accidentally\npicked up the business section.\nAnd this old man said,\n\"Hey youngster, you pick stocks?\"\nAnd I said, \"What's that?\"\nHe said, \"That's the place\nwhere white folks keep all their money.\"\n\n\n\n 3:15\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:16\n\n\nAnd it was the first time\nthat I saw a glimpse of hope,\na future.\nHe gave me this brief description\nof what stocks were,\nbut it was just a glimpse.\nI mean, how was I supposed to do it?\nI couldn't read, write or spell.\nThe skills that I had developed\nto hide my illiteracy\nno longer worked in this environment.\nI was trapped in a cage,\nprey among predators,\nfighting for freedom I never had.\nI was lost, tired,\nand I was out of options.\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\nSo at 20 years old,\nI did the hardest thing\nI'd ever done in my life.\nI picked up a book,\nand it was the most agonizing\ntime of my life,\ntrying to learn how to read,\nthe ostracizing from my family,\nthe homeys.\nIt was rough, man.\nIt was a struggle.\nBut little did I know\nI was receiving the greatest gifts\nI had ever dreamed of:\nself-worth,\nknowledge, discipline.\nI was so excited to be reading that I read\neverything I could get my hands on:\ncandy wrappers, clothing logos,\nstreet signs, everything.\nI was just reading stuff!\n\n\n\n 4:28\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 4:29\n\n\nJust reading stuff.\nI was so excited to know how to read\nand know how to spell.\nThe homey came up, said,\n\"Man, what you eating?\"\nI said, \"C-A-N-D-Y, candy.\"\n\n\n\n 4:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:42\n\n\nHe said, \"Let me get some.\"\nI said, \"N-O. No.\"\n\n\n\n 4:44\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\nIt was awesome.\nI mean, I can actually now\nfor the first time in my life read.\nThe feeling that I got\nfrom it was amazing.\n\n\n\n 4:54\n\n\nAnd then at 22, feeling myself,\nfeeling confident,\nI remembered what the OG told me.\nSo I picked up the business section\nof the newspaper.\nI wanted to find these rich white folks.\n\n\n\n 5:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\nSo I looked for that glimpse.\nAs I furthered my career\nin teaching others how to\nfinancially manage money and invest,\nI soon learned that I had to take\nresponsibility for my own actions.\nTrue, I grew up\nin a very complex environment,\nbut I chose to commit crimes,\nand I had to own up to that.\nI had to take responsibility\nfor that, and I did.\nI was building a curriculum\nthat could teach incarcerated men\nhow to manage money\nthrough prison employments.\nProperly managing our lifestyle\nwould provide transferrable tools\nthat we can use to manage money\nwhen we reenter society,\nlike the majority of people did\nwho didn't commit crimes.\nThen I discovered\nthat according to MarketWatch,\nover 60 percent of the American population\nhas under 1,000 dollars in savings.\nSports Illustrated said that\nover 60 percent of NBA players\nand NFL players go broke.\n40 percent of marital problems\nderive from financial issues.\nWhat the hell?\n\n\n\n 6:09\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:11\n\n\nYou mean to tell me\nthat people worked their whole lives,\nbuying cars, clothes,\nhomes and material stuff\nbut were living check to check?\nHow in the world were members of society\ngoing to help incarcerated individuals\nback into society\nif they couldn't manage they own stuff?\nWe screwed.\n\n\n\n 6:28\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\nI needed a better plan.\nThis is not going to work out too well.\nSo ...\nI thought.\nI now had an obligation\nto meet those on the path\nand help,\nand it was crazy because\nI now cared about my community.\nWow, imagine that.\nI cared about my community.\n\n\n\n 6:55\n\n\nFinancial illiteracy is a disease\nthat has crippled minorities\nand the lower class in our society\nfor generations and generations,\nand we should be furious about that.\nAsk yourselves this:\nHow can 50 percent\nof the American population\nbe financially illiterate in a nation\ndriven by financial prosperity?\nOur access to justice, our social status,\nliving conditions, transportation and food\nare all dependent on money\nthat most people can't manage.\nIt's crazy!\nIt's an epidemic\nand a bigger danger to public safety\nthan any other issue.\n\n\n\n 7:32\n\n\nAccording to the California\nDepartment of Corrections,\nover 70 percent of those incarcerated\nhave committed or have been charged\nwith money-related crimes:\nrobberies, burglaries,\nfraud, larceny, extortion —\nand the list goes on.\nCheck this out:\na typical incarcerated person\nwould enter the California prison system\nwith no financial education,\nearn 30 cents an hour,\nover 800 dollars a year,\nwith no real expenses and save no money.\nUpon his parole, he will be given\n200 dollars gate money and told,\n\"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble.\nDon't come back to prison.\"\nWith no meaningful preparation\nor long-term financial plan,\nwhat does he do ... ?\nAt 60?\nGet a good job,\nor go back to the very criminal behavior\nthat led him to prison in the first place?\nYou taxpayers, you choose.\nWell, his education\nalready chose for him, probably.\n\n\n\n 8:34\n\n\nSo how do we cure this disease?\nI cofounded a program\nthat we call Financial Empowerment\nEmotional Literacy.\nWe call it FEEL,\nand it teaches how do you separate\nyour emotional decisions\nfrom your financial decisions,\nand the four timeless rules\nto personal finance:\nthe proper way to save,\ncontrol your cost of living,\nborrow money effectively\nand diversify your finances\nby allowing your money to work for you\ninstead of you working for it.\nIncarcerated people need these life skills\nbefore we reenter society.\nYou can't have full rehabilitation\nwithout these life skills.\nThis idea that only professionals\ncan invest and manage money\nis absolutely ridiculous,\nand whoever told you that is lying.\n\n\n\n 9:24\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:29\n\n\nA professional is a person\nwho knows his craft better than most,\nand nobody knows how much money\nyou need, have or want better than you,\nwhich means you are the professional.\nFinancial literacy is not a skill,\nladies and gentlemen.\nIt's a lifestyle.\nFinancial stability is a byproduct\nof a proper lifestyle.\nA financially sound incarcerated person\ncan become a taxpaying citizen,\nand a financially sound\ntaxpaying citizen can remain one.\nThis allows us to create a bridge\nbetween those people who we influence:\nfamily, friends and those young people\nwho still believe\nthat crime and money are related.\nSo let's lose the fear and anxiety\nof all the big financial words\nand all that other nonsense\nthat you've been out there hearing.\nAnd let's get to the heart\nof what's been crippling our society\nfrom taking care of your responsibility\nto be better life managers.\nAnd let's provide a simple\nand easy to use curriculum\nthat gets to the heart, the heart\nof what financial empowerment\nand emotional literacy really is.\n\n\n\n10:39\n\n\nNow, if you're sitting out here\nin the audience and you said,\n\"Oh yeah, well, that ain't me\nand I don't buy it,\"\nthen come take my class —\n\n\n\n10:46\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:48\n\n\nso I can show you how much money\nit costs you every time you get emotional.\n\n\n\n10:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n10:58\n\n\nThank you very much. Thank you.\n\n\n\n11:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nOkay, I have no idea what we're going to play.\nI won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.\nI didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.\nSo I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.\n\n\n\n 0:22\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 5:57\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:06\n\n\nOkay, so first of all,\nlet's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,\n(Applause)\nBurniss Travis on the bass,\n(Applause)\nand Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.\n\n\n\n 6:21\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 6:24\n\n\nSo the bandstand, as we call it,\nthis is an incredible space.\nIt is really a sacred space.\nAnd one of the things that is really sacred about it\nis that you have no opportunity to think about the future,\nor the past.\nYou really are alive right here in this moment.\nThere are so many decisions being made\nwhen you walk on the bandstand.\nWe had no idea what key we were going to play in.\nIn the middle, we sort of made our way\ninto a song called \"Titi Boom.\"\nBut that could have happened — maybe, maybe not.\nEveryone's listening. We're responding.\nYou have no time for projected ideas.\n\n\n\n 6:57\n\n\nSo the idea of a mistake:\nFrom the perspective of a jazz musician,\nit's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.\nSo the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand —\nfirst of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.\nThe only mistake lies\nin that I'm not able to perceive\nwhat it is that someone else did.\nEvery \"mistake\" is an opportunity in jazz.\nSo it's hard to even describe\nwhat a funny note would be.\n\n\n\n 7:25\n\n\nSo for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,\nthat sounded like this ...\n(Music)\nSo if Christian played a note — like play an F.\n(Music)\nSee, these are all right inside of the color palette.\nIf you played an E.\nSee, these all lie right inside\nof this general emotional palette that we were painting.\nIf you played an F# though,\n(Dissonance)\nto most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.\n\n\n\n 7:56\n\n\nSo I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.\nAnd we're going to play on this palette.\nAnd at some point, Christian will introduce this note.\nAnd we won't react to it.\nHe'll introduce it for a second\nand then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.\nWe'll see what happens when we play with this palette.\n\n\n\n 8:10\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 8:35\n\n\nSo someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.\nThe only way that I would say it was a mistake\nis in that we didn't react to it.\nIt was an opportunity that was missed.\nSo it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.\nHe'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.\nWe'll all accept his ideas,\nor not.\n\n\n\n 8:55\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n10:04\n\n\nSo you see, he played this note.\nI ended up creating a melody out of it.\nThe texture changed in the drums this time.\nIt got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense\nin response to how I responded to it.\nSo there is no mistake.\nThe only mistake is if I'm not aware,\nif each individual musician is not aware\nand accepting enough of his fellow band member\nto incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\nSo jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.\nIt's a very purifying experience.\nAnd I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.\nWe know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.\nSo how does this all relate to behavioral finance?\nWell we're jazz musicians,\nso stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.\n\n\n\n10:48\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:51\n\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.\nAnd the other dynamic of it\nis that we don't micromanage in jazz.\nYou have some people who do.\nBut what that does\nis it actually limits the artistic possibilities.\nIf I come up and I dictate to the band\nthat I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,\nand I just jump right in ...\nready, just play some time.\nOne, two, one, two, three, four.\n(Music)\nIt's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.\nI'm telling them, \"You come with me over this way.\"\n\n\n\n11:32\n\n\nIf I really want the music to go there,\nthe best way for me to do it is to listen.\nThis is a science of listening.\nIt has far more to do with what I can perceive\nthan what it is that I can do.\nSo if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,\nthe first step for me is\nto be patient, to listen to what's going on\nand pull from something that's going on around me.\nWhen you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians\nand they give you more, and gradually it builds.\nWatch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.\n\n\n\n12:00\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n12:40\n\n\nTotally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.\nIt's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.\nIt's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.\nIt's about being here in the moment,\naccepting one another\nand allowing creativity to flow.\n\n\n\n12:53\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n12:55\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nIt's six o'clock in the morning,\npitch black outside.\nMy 14-year-old son\nis fast asleep in his bed,\nsleeping the reckless,\ndeep sleep of a teenager.\nI flip on the light and physically\nshake the poor boy awake,\nbecause I know that,\nlike ripping off a Band-Aid,\nit's better to get it over with quickly.\n\n\n\n 0:31\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:33\n\n\nI have a friend who yells \"Fire!\"\njust to rouse her sleeping teen.\nAnd another who got so fed up\nthat she had to dump cold water\non her son's head\njust to get him out of bed.\nSound brutal ...\nbut perhaps familiar?\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nEvery morning I ask myself,\n\"How can I —\nknowing what I know\nand doing what I do for a living —\nbe doing this to my own son?\"\nYou see,\nI'm a sleep researcher.\n\n\n\n 1:05\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nSo I know far too much about sleep\nand the consequences of sleep loss.\nI know that I'm depriving my son\nof the sleep he desperately needs\nas a rapidly growing teenager.\nI also know that by waking him up\nhours before his natural\nbiological clock tells him he's ready,\nI'm literally robbing him\nof his dreams —\nthe type of sleep most associated\nwith learning, memory consolidation\nand emotional processing.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nBut it's not just my kid\nthat's being deprived of sleep.\nSleep deprivation among\nAmerican teenagers is an epidemic.\nOnly about one in 10 gets\nthe eight to 10 hours of sleep per night\nrecommended by sleep scientists\nand pediatricians.\nNow, if you're thinking to yourself,\n\"Phew, we're doing good,\nmy kid's getting eight hours,\"\nremember,\neight hours is\nthe minimum recommendation.\nYou're barely passing.\nEight hours is kind of like\ngetting a C on your report card.\n\n\n\n 2:09\n\n\nThere are many factors\ncontributing to this epidemic,\nbut a major factor preventing teens\nfrom getting the sleep they need\nis actually a matter of public policy.\nNot hormones, social lives or Snapchat.\nAcross the country,\nmany schools are starting\naround 7:30am or earlier,\ndespite the fact that major\nmedical organizations recommend\nthat middle and high school\nstart no earlier than 8:30am.\nThese early start policies\nhave a direct effect on how much —\nor really how little sleep\nAmerican teenagers are getting.\n\n\n\n 2:51\n\n\nThey're also pitting\nteenagers and their parents\nin a fundamentally unwinnable fight\nagainst their own bodies.\nAround the time of puberty,\nteenagers experience a delay\nin their biological clock,\nwhich determines when we feel most awake\nand when we feel most sleepy.\nThis is driven in part by a shift\nin the release of the hormone melatonin.\nTeenagers' bodies wait to start releasing\nmelatonin until around 11pm,\nwhich is two hours later than what\nwe see in adults or younger children.\nThis means that waking a teenager up\nat 6am is the biological equivalent\nof waking an adult up at 4am.\nOn the unfortunate days\nwhen I have to wake up at 4am,\nI'm a zombie.\nFunctionally useless.\nI can't think straight,\nI'm irritable,\nand I probably shouldn't be driving a car.\nBut this is how many American\nteenagers feel every single school day.\nIn fact, many of the, shall we say,\nunpleasant characteristics\nthat we chalk up to being a teenager —\nmoodiness, irritability,\nlaziness, depression —\ncould be a product\nof chronic sleep deprivation.\nFor many teens\nbattling chronic sleep loss,\ntheir go-to strategy to compensate\nis consuming large quantities of caffeine\nin the form of venti frappuccinos,\nor energy drinks and shots.\nSo essentially,\nwe've got an entire population\nof tired but wired youth.\n\n\n\n 4:32\n\n\nAdvocates of sleep-friendly\nstart times know\nthat adolescence is a period\nof dramatic brain development,\nparticularly in the parts of the brain\nthat are responsible for those\nhigher order thinking processes,\nincluding reasoning, problem-solving\nand good judgment.\nIn other words, the very type\nof brain activity that's responsible\nfor reining in those impulsive\nand often risky behaviors\nthat are so characteristic of adolescence\nand that are so terrifying\nto us parents of teenagers.\nThey know that like the rest of us,\nwhen teenagers don't\nget the sleep they need,\ntheir brains, their bodies\nand behaviors suffer\nwith both immediate and lasting effects.\nThey can't concentrate,\ntheir attention plummets\nand many will even show\nbehavioral signs that mimic ADHD.\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nBut the consequences of teen sleep loss\ngo well beyond the classroom,\nsadly contributing to many\nof the mental health problems\nthat skyrocket during adolescence,\nincluding substance use,\ndepression and suicide.\nIn our work with teens\nfrom LA Unified School District,\nwe found that teens with sleep problems\nwere 55 percent more likely\nto have used alcohol in the past month.\nIn another study with over\n30,000 high school students,\nthey found that\nfor each hour of lost sleep,\nthere was a 38 percent increase\nin feeling sad or hopeless,\nand a 58 percent increase\nin teen suicide attempts.\nAnd if that's not enough,\nteens who skip out on sleep\nare at increased risk\nfor a host of physical health problems\nthat plague our country,\nincluding obesity,\nheart disease and diabetes.\nThen there's the risk\nof putting a sleep-deprived teen,\nwith a newly minted driver's license,\nbehind the wheel.\nStudies have shown that getting five hours\nor less of sleep per night\nis the equivalent of driving with a blood\nalcohol content above the legal limit.\n\n\n\n 6:47\n\n\nAdvocates of sleep-friendly start times,\nand researchers in this area,\nhave produced tremendous science\nshowing the tremendous benefits\nof later start times.\nThe findings are unequivocal,\nand as a sleep scientist,\nI rarely get to speak\nwith that kind of certainty.\nTeens from districts\nwith later start times get more sleep.\nTo the naysayers who may think\nthat if schools start later,\nteens will just stay up later,\nthe truth is,\ntheir bedtimes stay the same,\nbut their wake-up times get extended,\nresulting in more sleep.\nThey're more likely to show up for school;\nschool absences dropped\nby 25 percent in one district.\nAnd they're less likely to drop out.\nNot surprisingly,\nthey do better academically.\n\n\n\n 7:36\n\n\nSo this has real implications\nfor reducing the achievement gap.\nStandardized test scores\nin math and reading\ngo up by two to three percentage points.\nThat's as powerful as reducing class sizes\nby one-third fewer students,\nor replacing a so-so teacher\nin the classroom\nwith a truly outstanding one.\nTheir mental and physical health improves,\nand even their families are happier.\nI mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little\nmore pleasantness from our teens,\nand a little less crankiness?\nEven their communities are safer\nbecause car crash rates go down —\na 70 percent reduction in one district.\n\n\n\n 8:20\n\n\nGiven these tremendous benefits,\nyou might think,\nwell, this is a no-brainer, right?\nSo why have we as a society\nfailed to heed this call?\nOften the argument against later\nstart times goes something like this:\n\"Why should we delay\nstart times for teenagers?\nWe need to toughen them up\nso they're ready for the real world!\"\nBut that's like saying\nto the parent of a two-year-old,\n\"Don't let Johnny nap,\nor he won't be ready for kindergarten.\"\n\n\n\n 8:50\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:52\n\n\nDelaying start times also presents\nmany logistical challenges.\nNot just for students and their families,\nbut for communities as a whole.\nUpdating bus routes,\nincreased transportation costs,\nimpact on sports,\ncare before or after school.\nThese are the same concerns\nthat come up in district after district,\ntime and again around the country\nas school start times are debated.\nAnd they're legitimate concerns,\nbut these are problems\nwe have to work through.\nThey are not valid excuses\nfor failing to do the right thing\nfor our children,\nwhich is to start middle and high schools\nno earlier than 8:30am.\nAnd in districts around the country,\nbig and small,\nwho have made this change,\nthey found that these fears\nare often unfounded\nand far outweighed by the tremendous\nbenefits for student health\nand performance,\nand our collective public safety.\n\n\n\n 9:55\n\n\nSo tomorrow morning,\nwhen coincidentally we get\nto set our clocks back by an hour\nand you get that delicious\nextra hour of sleep,\nand the day seems a little longer,\nand a little more full of hope,\nthink about the tremendous power of sleep.\nAnd think about what a gift it would be\nfor our children to be able\nto wake up naturally,\nin harmony with their own biology.\n\n\n\n10:28\n\n\nThank you,\nand pleasant dreams.\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nOver the last 13 years —\none, three, 13 years —\nI've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel\nand partners around the world\nfor taking this idea, this concept,\nnoninvasive surgery,\nfrom the research lab to routine clinical use.\nAnd this is what I'll tell you about.\n13 years —\nfor some of you, you can empathize with that number.\nFor me, today, on this date,\nit's like a second bar mitzvah experience.\n\n\n\n 0:39\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:42\n\n\nSo this dream\nis really enabled\nby the convergence\nof two known technologies.\nOne is the focused ultrasound,\nand the other one is the\nvision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.\nSo let's first talk about focused ultrasound.\nAnd I hold in my hand\na tissue-mimicking phantom.\nIt is made out of silicon.\nIt is transparent, made just for you.\nSo you see, it's all intact,\ncompletely transparent.\nI'll take you now to the acoustic lab.\nYou see the phantom within the aquarium.\nThis is a setup I put in a physics lab.\nOn the right-hand side,\nyou see an ultrasonic transducer.\nSo the ultrasonic transducer\nemits basically an ultrasonic beam\nthat focuses inside the phantom.\nOkay, when you hear the click,\nthis is when the energy starts to emit\nand you see a little lesion form\ninside the phantom.\nOkay, so everything around it\nis whole and intact.\nIt's just a lesion formed inside.\nSo think about, this is in your brain.\nWe need to reach a target inside the brain.\nWe can do it without harming any tissue.\nSo this is, I think,\nthe first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.\n\n\n\n 2:07\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:09\n\n\nOkay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,\nthe force of ultrasound.\nYou know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.\nAnd you know also about lithotripsy —\nbreaking kidney stones.\nBut ultrasound can be shaped\nto be anything in between,\nbecause it's a mechanical force.\nBasically, it's a force acting on a tissue\nthat it transverses.\nSo you can change the intensity, the frequency,\nthe duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound\nto create anything\nfrom an airbrush to a hammer.\nAnd I am going to show you\nmultiple applications in the medical field\nthat can be enabled\njust by focusing,\nphysically focusing.\n\n\n\n 2:57\n\n\nSo this idea\nof harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain\nis not new at all.\nWhen I was born, this idea was already conceived\nby pioneers such as the Fry brothers\nand Lars Leksell,\nwho is know actually\nas the inventor of the gammaknife.\nBut you may not know\nthat he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,\nnoninvasively,\nwith focused ultrasound in the '50s.\nHe failed,\nso he then invented the gammaknife.\nAnd it makes you ponder\nwhy those pioneers failed.\nAnd there was something fundamental\nthat they were missing.\nThey were missing the vision.\nIt wasn't until the invention of the MR\nand really the integration of MR\nwith focused ultrasound\nthat we could get the feedback —\nboth the anatomical and the physiological\nin order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop\nsurgical procedure.\n\n\n\n 4:02\n\n\nSo this is how it looks, you know,\nthe operating room of the future today.\nThis is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.\nAnd I will give you several examples.\nSo the first one is in the brain.\nOne of the neurological conditions\nthat can be treated with focused ultrasound\nare movement disorders,\nlike Parkinson's or essential tremor.\nWhat is typical to those conditions,\nto essential tremor for example,\nis inability\nto drink or eat cereal or soup\nwithout spilling everything all over you,\nor write legibly so people can understand it,\nand be really independent in your life\nwithout the help of others.\n\n\n\n 4:48\n\n\nSo I'd like you to meet John.\nJohn is a retired professor of history\nfrom Virginia.\nSo he suffered from essential tremor for many years.\nAnd medication didn't help him anymore.\nAnd many of those patients refused to undergo surgery\nto have people cut into their brain.\nAnd about four or five months ago,\nhe underwent an experimental procedure.\nIt is approved under an FDAIDE\nat the University of Virginia\nin Charlottesville\nusing focused ultrasound\nto ablate a point in his thalamus.\nAnd this is his handwriting.\n\"On June 20th,\" if you can read it,\n\"2011.\"\nThis is his handwriting\non the morning of the treatment\nbefore going into the MR\nSo now I'll take you through\n[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,\n[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.\n\n\n\n 5:52\n\n\nSo we put the patient on the MR table.\nWe attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,\nbut if it will be a different organ,\nit will be a different transducer attached to the patient.\nAnd the physician\nwill then take a regular MR scan.\nAnd the objective of that?\nI don't have a pointer here,\nbut you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?\nThis is the sort of general area of the treatment.\nIt's a safety boundary\naround the target.\nIt's a target in the thalamus.\nSo once those pictures are acquired\nand the physician has drawn\nall the necessary safety limits and so on,\nhe selects basically a point —\nyou see the round point in the middle where the cursor is —\nand he presses this blue button called \"sonicate.\"\nWe call this instance of injecting the energy,\nwe call it sonication.\nThe only handwork the physician does here\nis moving a mouse.\nThis is the only device he needs in this treatment.\n\n\n\n 6:54\n\n\nSo he presses \"sonicate,\" and this is what happens.\nYou see the transducer, the light blue.\nThere's water in between the skull and the transducer.\nAnd it does this burst of energy.\nIt elevates the temperature.\nWe first need to verify\nthat we are on target.\nSo the first sonication\nis at lower energy.\nIt doesn't do any damage,\nbut it elevates the temperature\nby a few degrees.\nAnd one of the unique capabilities\nthat we leverage with the MR\nis the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.\nThis is really a unique capability of the MR.\nIt is not being used\nin regular diagnostic imaging.\nBut here we can get\nboth the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.\nAnd you can see the points there on the graph.\nThe temperature was raised\nto 43 degrees C temporarily.\nThis doesn't cause any damage.\nBut the point is we are right on target.\nSo once the physician verifies\nthat the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,\nthen we move to perform\na full-energy ablation\nlike you see here.\nAnd you see the temperature rises\nto like 55 to 60 degrees C.\nIf you do it for more than a second,\nit's enough to basically destroy\nthe proteins of the cells.\n\n\n\n 8:18\n\n\nThis is the outcome from a patient perspective —\nsame day after the treatment.\nThis is an immediate relief.\n(Applause)\nThank you.\nJohn is one of [about] a dozen\nvery heroic, courageous people\nwho volunteered for the study.\nAnd you have to understand\nwhat is in people's mind\nwhen they are willing to take the risk.\nAnd this is a quote from John after he wrote it.\nHe said, \"Miraculous.\"\nAnd his wife said, \"This is the happiest moment of my life.\"\nAnd you wonder why.\nI mean, one of the messages I like to carry over\nis, what about defending quality of life?\nI mean, those people lose their independence.\nThey are dependent on others.\nAnd John today is fully independent.\nHe returned to a normal life routine.\nAnd he also plays golf,\nlike you do in Virginia\nwhen you are retired.\nOkay, so you can see here the spot.\nIt's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.\nThere's no damage outside.\nHe suffers from no neurodeficit.\nThere's no recovery needed, no nothing.\nHe's back to his normal life.\n\n\n\n 9:40\n\n\nLet's move now\nto a more painful subject.\nPain is something\nthat can make your life miserable.\nAnd people are suffering from all kinds of pain\nlike neuropathic pain, lower-back pain\nand cancer pain from bone metastases,\nwhen the metastases get to your bones,\nsometimes they are very painful.\nAll those I've indicated\nhave already been shown\nto be successfully treated\nby focused ultrasound\nrelieving the pain, again, very fast.\nAnd I would like to tell you\nabout PJ.\nHe's a 78 year-old farmer\nwho suffered from — how should I say it? —\nit's called pain in the butt.\nHe had metastases in his right buttock,\nand he couldn't sit\neven with medication.\nHe had to forgo all the farm activities.\nHe was treated with radiation therapy,\nstate-of-the-art radiation therapy,\nbut it didn't help.\nMany patients like that favor radiation therapy.\n\n\n\n10:53\n\n\nAnd again, he volunteered\nto a pivotal study\nthat we ran worldwide,\nalso in the U.S.\nAnd his wife actually took him.\nThey drove like three hours\nfrom their farm to the hospital.\nHe had to sit on a cushion,\nstand still, not move,\nbecause it was very painful.\nHe took the treatment,\nand on the way back,\nhe drove the truck by himself.\nSo again, this is an immediate relief.\nAnd you have to understand\nwhat those people feel\nand what their family experiences\nwhen it happens.\nHe returned again\nto his daily routine on the farm.\nHe rides his tractor.\nHe rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.\nAnd he has been very happy.\n\n\n\n11:54\n\n\nBut now, you ask me,\nbut what about war, the war on cancer?\nShow us some primary cancer.\nWhat can be done there?\nSo I have good news and bad news.\nThe good news: there's a lot that can be done.\nAnd it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.\nAnd doing that in the U.S.\nis very painful.\nI don't see, without this nation\ntaking it as some collective will\nor something that is a national goal to make that happen,\nit will not happen.\nAnd it's not just because of regulation;\nit's because of the amount of money needed\nunder the current evidence-based medicine\nand the size of trials and so on\nto make it happen.\n\n\n\n12:44\n\n\nSo the first two applications\nare breast cancer and prostate cancer.\nThey were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.\nAnd we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.\nBut I have a message for the men here.\nWe heard here yesterday Quyen\ntalking about the adverse event trait\nin prostate cancer.\nThere is a unique opportunity now\nwith focused ultrasound guided by MR,\nbecause we can actually think about\nprostate lumpectomy —\ntreating just the focal lesion\nand not removing the whole gland,\nand by that, avoiding all the issues\nwith potency and incontinence.\nWell, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen —\nquite lethal, very lethal actually —\npancreas, liver, kidney.\nThe challenge there\nwith a breathing and awake patient —\nand in all our treatments,\nthe patient is awake and conscious\nand speaks with the physician —\nis you have to teach the MR some tricks\nhow to do it in real time.\nAnd this will take time.\nThis will take two years.\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\nBut I have now a message to the ladies.\nAnd this is, in 2004,\nthe FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds\nfor the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.\nWomen suffer from that disease.\nAll those tumors\nhave heavy bleeding during periods,\nabdominal pressure, back pain,\nfrequent urination.\nAnd sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant\nbecause of the fibroid.\nThis is Frances.\nShe was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.\nThis is a big fibroid.\nShe was offered a hysterectomy,\nbut this is an inconceivable proposition\nfor someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.\nSo she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure\nin 2008.\nAnd in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.\nSo new life was born.\n\n\n\n14:59\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n15:01\n\n\nSo in conclusion,\nI'd like to leave you with actually four messages.\nOne is, think about the amount\nof suffering that is saved\nfrom patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,\nand also the economical and emotional burden\nremoved from their families and communities\nand the society at large —\nand I think also from their physicians, by the way.\nAnd the other thing I would like you to think about\nis the new type of relationship\nbetween physician and patients\nwhen you have a patient on the table\n[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.\nIn all our treatments,\nthe patient holds a stop sonication button.\nHe can stop the surgery at any moment.\n\n\n\n15:54\n\n\nAnd with that note,\nI would like to thank you for listening.\n\n\n\n16:00\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'm an underwater explorer,\nmore specifically a cave diver.\n\n\n\n 0:20\n\n\nI wanted to be an astronaut\nwhen I was a little kid,\nbut growing up in Canada as a young girl,\nthat wasn't really available to me.\nBut as it turns out,\nwe know a lot more about space\nthan we do about the underground waterways\ncoursing through our planet,\nthe very lifeblood of Mother Earth.\nSo I decided to do something\nthat was even more remarkable.\nInstead of exploring outer space,\nI wanted to explore\nthe wonders of inner space.\n\n\n\n 0:50\n\n\nNow, a lot of people will tell you\nthat cave diving is perhaps\none of the most dangerous endeavors.\nI mean, imagine yourself\nhere in this room,\nif you were suddenly\nplunged into blackness,\nwith your only job to find the exit,\nsometimes swimming\nthrough these large spaces,\nand at other times\ncrawling beneath the seats,\nfollowing a thin guideline,\njust waiting for the life support\nto provide your very next breath.\nWell, that's my workplace.\n\n\n\n 1:21\n\n\nBut what I want to teach you today\nis that our world\nis not one big solid rock.\nIt's a whole lot more like a sponge.\nI can swim through a lot of the pores\nin our earth's sponge,\nbut where I can't,\nother life-forms and other materials\ncan make that journey without me.\nAnd my voice is the one\nthat's going to teach you\nabout the inside of Mother Earth.\n\n\n\n 1:49\n\n\nThere was no guidebook available to me\nwhen I decided to be the first person\nto cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.\nIn 2000, this was the largest\nmoving object on the planet.\nIt calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,\nand we went down there\nto explore ice edge ecology\nand search for life-forms beneath the ice.\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\nWe use a technology called rebreathers.\nIt's an awful lot like the same technology\nthat is used for space walks.\nThis technology enables us to go deeper\nthan we could've imagined\neven 10 years ago.\nWe use exotic gases,\nand we can make missions\neven up to 20 hours long underwater.\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\nI work with biologists.\nIt turns out that caves\nare repositories of amazing life-forms,\nspecies that we never knew existed before.\nMany of these life-forms\nlive in unusual ways.\nThey have no pigment\nand no eyes in many cases,\nand these animals\nare also extremely long-lived.\nIn fact, animals swimming\nin these caves today\nare identical in the fossil record\nthat predates the extinction\nof the dinosaurs.\nSo imagine that: these are\nlike little swimming dinosaurs.\nWhat can they teach us\nabout evolution and survival?\nWhen we look at an animal\nlike this remipede swimming in the jar,\nhe has giant fangs with venom.\nHe can actually attack something\n40 times his size and kill it.\nIf he were the size of a cat,\nhe'd be the most dangerous\nthing on our planet.\nAnd these animals live\nin remarkably beautiful places,\nand in some cases,\ncaves like this, that are very young,\nyet the animals are ancient.\nHow did they get there?\n\n\n\n 3:40\n\n\nI also work with physicists,\nand they're interested oftentimes\nin global climate change.\nThey can take rocks within the caves,\nand they can slice them\nand look at the layers within with rocks,\nmuch like the rings of a tree,\nand they can count back in history\nand learn about the climate on our planet\nat very different times.\nThe red that you see in this photograph\nis actually dust from the Sahara Desert.\nSo it's been picked up by wind,\nblown across the Atlantic Ocean.\nIt's rained down in this case\non the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.\nIt soaks in through the ground\nand deposits itself\nin the rocks within these caves.\nAnd when we look back in the layers\nof these rocks, we can find times\nwhen the climate\nwas very, very dry on earth,\nand we can go back\nmany hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n\n\n 4:31\n\n\nPaleoclimatologists are also interested\nin where the sea level stands were\nat other times on earth.\nHere in Bermuda, my team and I embarked\non the deepest manned dives\never conducted in the region,\nand we were looking for places\nwhere the sea level\nused to lap up against the shoreline,\nmany hundreds of feet\nbelow current levels.\n\n\n\n 4:51\n\n\nI also get to work with paleontologists\nand archaeologists.\nIn places like Mexico,\nin the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,\nwe're looking at cultural remains\nand also human remains in caves,\nand they tell us a lot\nabout some of the earliest\ninhabitants of these regions.\n\n\n\n 5:09\n\n\nBut my very favorite project of all\nwas over 15 years ago,\nwhen I was a part of the team\nthat made the very first\naccurate, three-dimensional map\nof a subterranean surface.\nThis device that I'm\ndriving through the cave\nwas actually creating\na three-dimensional model as we drove it.\nWe also used ultra low frequency radio\nto broadcast back to the surface\nour exact position within the cave.\nSo I swam under houses and businesses\nand bowling alleys and golf courses,\nand even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,\n\n\n\n 5:42\n\n\nPretty remarkable, and what that taught me\nwas that everything we do\non the surface of our earth\nwill be returned to us to drink.\nOur water planet is not just\nrivers, lakes and oceans,\nbut it's this vast network of groundwater\nthat knits us all together.\nIt's a shared resource\nfrom which we all drink.\nAnd when we can understand\nour human connections with our groundwater\nand all of our water resources\non this planet,\nthen we'll be working on the problem\nthat's probably the most important\nissue of this century.\n\n\n\n 6:16\n\n\nSo I never got to be that astronaut\nthat I always wanted to be,\nbut this mapping device,\ndesigned by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.\nIt's actually morphed.\nIt's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,\nartificially intelligent,\nand its ultimate goal\nis to go to Jupiter's moon Europa\nand explore oceans beneath\nthe frozen surface of that body.\n\n\n\n 6:38\n\n\nAnd that's pretty amazing.\n\n\n\n 6:41\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nSo historically there has\nbeen a huge divide between what people\nconsider to be non-living systems on one\nside, and living systems on the other side.\nSo we go from, say, this beautiful and\ncomplex crystal as non-life, and this rather\nbeautiful and complex cat on the other side.\nOver the last hundred and fifty years or so,\nscience has kind of blurred this distinction\nbetween non-living and living systems, and\nnow we consider that there may be a kind\nof continuum that exists between the two.\nWe'll just take one example here:\na virus is a natural system, right?\nBut it's very simple. It's very simplistic.\nIt doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,\nit doesn't have all the characteristics\nof living systems and is in fact a parasite\non other living systems in order to, say,\nreproduce and evolve.\n\n\n\n 0:58\n\n\nBut what we're going to be talking about here\ntonight are experiments done on this sort of\nnon-living end of this spectrum — so actually\ndoing chemical experiments in the laboratory,\nmixing together nonliving ingredients\nto make new structures, and that these\nnew structures might have some of the\ncharacteristics of living systems.\nReally what I'm talking about here is\ntrying to create a kind of artificial life.\n\n\n\n 1:19\n\n\nSo what are these characteristics that I'm\ntalking about? These are them.\nWe consider first that life has a body.\nNow this is necessary to distinguish the self\nfrom the environment.\nLife also has a metabolism. Now this is a\nprocess by which life can convert resources\nfrom the environment into building blocks\nso it can maintain and build itself.\nLife also has a kind of inheritable information.\nNow we, as humans, we store our information\nas DNA in our genomes and we pass this\ninformation on to our offspring.\nIf we couple the first two — the body and the metabolism —\nwe can come up with a system that could\nperhaps move and replicate, and if we\ncoupled these now to inheritable information,\nwe can come up with a system that would be\nmore lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.\nAnd so these are the things we will try to do\nin the lab, make some experiments that have\none or more of these characteristics of life.\n\n\n\n 2:08\n\n\nSo how do we do this? Well, we use\na model system that we term a protocell.\nYou might think of this as kind of like a\nprimitive cell. It is a simple chemical\nmodel of a living cell, and if you consider\nfor example a cell in your body may have\non the order of millions of different types\nof molecules that need to come together,\nplay together in a complex network\nto produce something that we call alive.\nIn the laboratory what we want to do\nis much the same, but with on the order of\ntens of different types of molecules —\nso a drastic reduction in complexity, but still\ntrying to produce something that looks lifelike.\nAnd so what we do is, we start simple\nand we work our way up to living systems.\nConsider for a moment this quote by\nLeduc, a hundred years ago, considering a\nkind of synthetic biology:\n\"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,\nwill not be the sensational discovery which we\nusually associate with the idea.\"\nThat's his first statement. So if we actually\ncreate life in the laboratories, it's\nprobably not going to impact our lives at all.\n\n\n\n 3:04\n\n\n\"If we accept the theory of evolution, then\nthe first dawn of synthesis of life must consist\nin the production of forms intermediate\nbetween the inorganic and the organic\nworld, or between the non-living\nand living world, forms which possess\nonly some of the rudimentary attributes of life\"\n— so, the ones I just discussed —\n\"to which other attributes will be slowly added\nin the course of development by the\nevolutionary actions of the environment.\"\nSo we start simple, we make some structures\nthat may have some of these characteristics\nof life, and then we try to develop that\nto become more lifelike.\nThis is how we can start to make a protocell.\nWe use this idea called self-assembly.\nWhat that means is, I can mix some\nchemicals together in a test tube in my lab,\nand these chemicals will start to self-associate\nto form larger and larger structures.\nSo say on the order of tens of thousands,\nhundreds of thousands of molecules will\ncome together to form a large structure\nthat didn't exist before.\nAnd in this particular example,\nwhat I took is some membrane molecules,\nmixed those together in the right environment,\nand within seconds it forms these rather\ncomplex and beautiful structures here.\nThese membranes are also quite similar,\nmorphologically and functionally,\nto the membranes in your body,\nand we can use these, as they say,\nto form the body of our protocell.\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nLikewise,\nwe can work with oil and water systems.\nAs you know, when you put oil and water together,\nthey don't mix, but through self-assembly\nwe can get a nice oil droplet to form,\nand we can actually use this as a body for\nour artificial organism or for our protocell,\nas you will see later.\nSo that's just forming some body stuff, right?\nSome architectures.\nWhat about the other aspects of living systems?\nSo we came up with this protocell model here\nthat I'm showing.\nWe started with a natural occurring clay\ncalled montmorillonite.\nThis is natural from the environment, this clay.\nIt forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.\nIt could run a metabolism on it.\nCertain kind of molecules like to associate\nwith the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red\n— this is a relative of DNA,\nit's an informational molecule —\nit can come along and it starts to associate\nwith the surface of this clay.\nThis structure, then, can organize the\nformation of a membrane boundary around\nitself, so it can make a body of\nliquid molecules around itself, and that's\nshown in green here on this micrograph.\nSo just through self-assembly, mixing things\ntogether in the lab, we can come up with, say,\na metabolic surface with some\ninformational molecules attached\ninside of this membrane body, right?\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\nSo we're on a road towards living systems.\nBut if you saw this protocell, you would not\nconfuse this with something that was actually alive.\nIt's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,\nit doesn't really do anything.\nSo, something is missing.\nSome things are missing.\nSo some things that are missing is,\nfor example, if you had a flow of energy\nthrough a system, what we'd want\nis a protocell that can harvest\nsome of that energy in order to maintain itself,\nmuch like living systems do.\nSo we came up with a different protocell\nmodel, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.\nIn this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,\nbut a chemical metabolism inside\nthat allows this protocell to use energy\nto do something, to actually become dynamic,\nas we'll see here.\nYou add the droplet to the system.\nIt's a pool of water, and the protocell\nstarts moving itself around in the system.\nOkay? Oil droplet forms\nthrough self-assembly, has a chemical\nmetabolism inside so it can use energy,\nand it uses that energy to move itself\naround in its environment.\n\n\n\n 6:21\n\n\nAs we heard earlier, movement is very\nimportant in these kinds of living systems.\nIt is moving around, exploring its environment,\nand remodeling its environment, as you see,\nby these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.\nSo it's acting, in a sense, like a living system\ntrying to preserve itself.\nWe take this same moving protocell here,\nand we put it in another experiment,\nget it moving. Then I'm going\nto add some food to the system,\nand you'll see that in blue here, right?\nSo I add some food source to the system.\nThe protocell moves. It encounters the food.\nIt reconfigures itself and actually then\nis able to climb to the highest concentration\nof food in that system and stop there.\nAlright? So not only do we have this system\nthat has a body, it has a metabolism,\nit can use energy, it moves around.\nIt can sense its local environment\nand actually find resources\nin the environment to sustain itself.\n\n\n\n 7:11\n\n\nNow, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have\na neural system. This is just a sack of\nchemicals that is able to have this interesting\nand complex lifelike behavior.\nIf we count the number of chemicals\nin that system, actually, including the water\nthat's in the dish, we have five chemicals\nthat can do this.\nSo then we put these protocells together in a\nsingle experiment to see what they would do,\nand depending on the conditions, we have\nsome protocells on the left that are\nmoving around and it likes to touch the other\nstructures in its environment.\nOn the other hand we have two moving\nprotocells that like to circle each other,\nand they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.\nRight? So not only do individual protocells\nhave behavior, what we've interpreted as\nbehavior in this system, but we also have\nbasically population-level behavior\nsimilar to what organisms have.\nSo now that you're all experts on protocells,\nwe're going to play a game with these protocells.\nWe're going to make two different kinds.\nProtocell A has a certain kind of chemistry\ninside that, when activated, the protocell\nstarts to vibrate around, just dancing.\nSo remember, these are primitive things,\nso dancing protocells, that's very\ninteresting to us. (Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:17\n\n\nThe second protocell has a different\nchemistry inside, and when activated,\nthe protocells all come together and they fuse\ninto one big one. Right?\nAnd we just put these two together\nin the same system.\nSo there's population A,\nthere's population B, and then\nwe activate the system,\nand protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,\nthey all come together. They fuse together\nto form one big blob, and the other protocell\njust dances around. And this just happens\nuntil all of the energy in the system is\nbasically used up, and then, game over.\nSo then I repeated this experiment\na bunch of times, and one time\nsomething very interesting happened.\nSo, I added these protocells together\nto the system, and protocell A and protocell B\nfused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.\nThat didn't happen before. There it goes.\nThere's a protocell AB now in this system.\nProtocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,\nwhile protocell B does the fusing, okay?\n\n\n\n 9:11\n\n\nBut then something even more interesting happens.\nWatch when these two large protocells,\nthe hybrid ones, fuse together.\nNow we have a dancing protocell\nand a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)\nJust with blobs of chemicals, again.\nSo the way this works is, you have\na simple system of five chemicals here,\na simple system here. When they hybridize,\nyou then form something that's different than\nbefore, it's more complex than before,\nand you get the emergence of another kind of\nlifelike behavior which\nin this case is replication.\n\n\n\n 9:43\n\n\nSo since we can make some interesting\nprotocells that we like, interesting colors and\ninteresting behaviors, and they're very easy\nto make, and they have interesting lifelike\nproperties, perhaps these protocells have\nsomething to tell us about the origin of life\non the Earth. Perhaps these represent an\neasily accessible step, one of the first steps\nby which life got started on the early Earth.\nCertainly, there were molecules present on\nthe early Earth, but they wouldn't have been\nthese pure compounds that we worked with\nin the lab and I showed in these experiments.\nRather, they'd be a real complex mixture of\nall kinds of stuff, because\nuncontrolled chemical reactions produce\na diverse mixture of organic compounds.\nThink of it like a primordial ooze, okay?\nAnd it's a pool that's too difficult to fully\ncharacterize, even by modern methods, and\nthe product looks brown, like this tar here\non the left. A pure compound\nis shown on the right, for contrast.\n\n\n\n10:32\n\n\nSo this is similar to what happens when you\ntake pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,\nyou put them in a pan, and you apply energy.\nYou turn up the heat, you start making\nor breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,\nforming a brownish caramel, right?\nIf you let that go unregulated, you'll\ncontinue to make and break chemical bonds,\nforming an even more diverse mixture of\nmolecules that then forms this kind of black\ntarry stuff in your pan, right, that's\ndifficult to wash out. So that's what\nthe origin of life would have looked like.\nYou needed to get life out of this junk that\nis present on the early Earth,\nfour, 4.5 billion years ago.\nSo the challenge then is,\nthrow away all your pure chemicals in the lab,\nand try to make some protocells with lifelike\nproperties from this kind of primordial ooze.\n\n\n\n11:13\n\n\nSo we're able to then see the self-assembly\nof these oil droplet bodies again\nthat we've seen previously,\nand the black spots inside of there\nrepresent this kind of black tar — this diverse,\nvery complex, organic black tar.\nAnd we put them into one of these\nexperiments, as you've seen earlier, and then\nwe watch lively movement that comes out.\nThey look really good, very nice movement,\nand also they appear to have some kind of\nbehavior where they kind of circle\naround each other and follow each other,\nsimilar to what we've seen before — but again,\nworking with just primordial conditions,\nno pure chemicals.\nThese are also, these tar-fueled protocells,\nare also able to locate resources\nin their environment.\nI'm going to add some resource from the left,\nhere, that defuses into the system,\nand you can see, they really like that.\nThey become very energetic, and able\nto find the resource in the environment,\nsimilar to what we saw before.\nBut again, these are done in these primordial\nconditions, really messy conditions,\nnot sort of sterile laboratory conditions.\nThese are very dirty little protocells,\nas a matter of fact. (Laughter)\nBut they have lifelike properties, is the point.\n\n\n\n12:16\n\n\nSo, doing these artificial life experiments\nhelps us define a potential path between\nnon-living and living systems.\nAnd not only that, but it helps us\nbroaden our view of what life is\nand what possible life there could be\nout there — life that could be very different\nfrom life that we find here on Earth.\nAnd that leads me to the next\nterm, which is \"weird life.\"\nThis is a term by Steve Benner.\nThis is used in reference to a report\nin 2007 by the National Research Council\nin the United States, wherein\nthey tried to understand how we can\nlook for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,\nespecially if that life is very different from life\non Earth. If we went to another planet and\nwe thought there might be life there,\nhow could we even recognize it as life?\n\n\n\n13:02\n\n\nWell, they came up with three very general\ncriteria. First is — and they're listed here.\nThe first is, the system has to be in\nnon-equilibrium. That means the system\ncannot be dead, in a matter of fact.\nBasically what that means is, you have\nan input of energy into the system that life\ncan use and exploit to maintain itself.\nThis is similar to having the Sun shining\non the Earth, driving photosynthesis,\ndriving the ecosystem.\nWithout the Sun, there's likely to be\nno life on this planet.\nSecondly, life needs to be in liquid form,\nso that means even if we had some\ninteresting structures, interesting molecules\ntogether but they were frozen solid,\nthen this is not a good place for life.\nAnd thirdly, we need to be able to make\nand break chemical bonds. And again\nthis is important because life transforms\nresources from the environment into\nbuilding blocks so it can maintain itself.\n\n\n\n13:48\n\n\nNow today, I told you about very strange\nand weird protocells — some that contain clay,\nsome that have primordial ooze in them,\nsome that have basically oil\ninstead of water inside of them.\nMost of these don't contain DNA,\nbut yet they have lifelike properties.\nBut these protocells satisfy\nthese general requirements of living systems.\nSo by making these chemical, artificial\nlife experiments, we hope not only\nto understand something fundamental\nabout the origin of life and the existence\nof life on this planet, but also\nwhat possible life there could be\nout there in the universe. Thank you.\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\n[His Holiness Pope Francis\nFilmed in Vatican City\nFirst shown at TED2017]\n\n\n\n 0:15\n\n\nGood evening – or, good morning,\nI am not sure what time it is there.\nRegardless of the hour, I am thrilled\nto be participating in your conference.\nI very much like its title\n– \"The Future You\" –\nbecause, while looking at tomorrow,\nit invites us to open a dialogue today,\nto look at the future through a \"you.\"\n\"The Future You:\"\nthe future is made of yous,\nit is made of encounters,\nbecause life flows\nthrough our relations with others.\nQuite a few years of life\nhave strengthened my conviction\nthat each and everyone's existence\nis deeply tied to that of others:\nlife is not time merely passing by,\nlife is about interactions.\n\n\n\n 1:27\n\n\nAs I meet, or lend an ear\nto those who are sick,\nto the migrants\nwho face terrible hardships\nin search of a brighter future,\nto prison inmates who carry\na hell of pain inside their hearts,\nand to those, many of them young,\nwho cannot find a job,\nI often find myself wondering:\n\"Why them and not me?\"\nI, myself, was born\nin a family of migrants;\nmy father, my grandparents,\nlike many other Italians,\nleft for Argentina\nand met the fate of those\nwho are left with nothing.\nI could have very well ended up\namong today's \"discarded\" people.\nAnd that's why I always ask myself,\ndeep in my heart:\n\"Why them and not me?\"\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\nFirst and foremost, I would love it\nif this meeting could help to remind us\nthat we all need each other,\nnone of us is an island,\nan autonomous and independent \"I,\"\nseparated from the other,\nand we can only build the future\nby standing together, including everyone.\nWe don’t think about it often,\nbut everything is connected,\nand we need to restore\nour connections to a healthy state.\nEven the harsh judgment I hold in my heart\nagainst my brother or my sister,\nthe open wound that was never cured,\nthe offense that was never forgiven,\nthe rancor that is only going to hurt me,\nare all instances of a fight\nthat I carry within me,\na flare deep in my heart\nthat needs to be extinguished\nbefore it goes up in flames,\nleaving only ashes behind.\n\n\n\n 3:38\n\n\nMany of us, nowadays,\nseem to believe that a happy future\nis something impossible to achieve.\nWhile such concerns\nmust be taken very seriously,\nthey are not invincible.\nThey can be overcome when we don't lock\nour door to the outside world.\nHappiness can only be discovered\nas a gift of harmony between the whole\nand each single component.\nEven science – and you know it\nbetter than I do –\npoints to an understanding of reality\nas a place where every element connects\nand interacts with everything else.\n\n\n\n 4:27\n\n\nAnd this brings me to my second message.\nHow wonderful would it be\nif the growth of scientific\nand technological innovation\nwould come along with more equality\nand social inclusion.\nHow wonderful would it be,\nwhile we discover faraway planets,\nto rediscover the needs of the brothers\nand sisters orbiting around us.\nHow wonderful would it be if solidarity,\nthis beautiful and, at times,\ninconvenient word,\nwere not simply reduced to social work,\nand became, instead, the default attitude\nin political, economic\nand scientific choices,\nas well as in the relationships\namong individuals, peoples and countries.\nOnly by educating people\nto a true solidarity\nwill we be able to overcome\nthe \"culture of waste,\"\nwhich doesn't concern only food and goods\nbut, first and foremost, the people\nwho are cast aside\nby our techno-economic systems\nwhich, without even realizing it,\nare now putting products\nat their core, instead of people.\n\n\n\n 6:08\n\n\nSolidarity is a term that many wish\nto erase from the dictionary.\nSolidarity, however,\nis not an automatic mechanism.\nIt cannot be programmed or controlled.\nIt is a free response born\nfrom the heart of each and everyone.\nYes, a free response!\nWhen one realizes\nthat life, even in the middle\nof so many contradictions, is a gift,\nthat love is the source\nand the meaning of life,\nhow can they withhold their urge\nto do good to another fellow being?\n\n\n\n 6:50\n\n\nIn order to do good,\nwe need memory, we need courage\nand we need creativity.\nAnd I know that TED\ngathers many creative minds.\nYes, love does require\na creative, concrete\nand ingenious attitude.\nGood intentions and conventional formulas,\nso often used to appease\nour conscience, are not enough.\nLet us help each other,\nall together, to remember\nthat the other is not\na statistic or a number.\nThe other has a face.\nThe \"you\" is always a real presence,\na person to take care of.\n\n\n\n 7:52\n\n\nThere is a parable Jesus told\nto help us understand the difference\nbetween those who'd rather not be bothered\nand those who take care of the other.\nI am sure you have heard it before.\nIt is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nWhen Jesus was asked:\n\"Who is my neighbor?\" -\nnamely, \"Who should I take care of?\" -\nhe told this story, the story of a man\nwho had been assaulted, robbed,\nbeaten and abandoned along a dirt road.\nUpon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,\ntwo very influential people of the time,\nwalked past him without stopping to help.\nAfter a while, a Samaritan, a very much\ndespised ethnicity at the time, walked by.\nSeeing the injured man\nlying on the ground,\nhe did not ignore him\nas if he weren't even there.\nInstead, he felt compassion for this man,\nwhich compelled him to act\nin a very concrete manner.\nHe poured oil and wine\non the wounds of the helpless man,\nbrought him to a hostel\nand paid out of his pocket\nfor him to be assisted.\n\n\n\n 9:26\n\n\nThe story of the Good Samaritan\nis the story of today’s humanity.\nPeople's paths are riddled with suffering,\nas everything is centered around money,\nand things, instead of people.\nAnd often there is this habit, by people\nwho call themselves \"respectable,\"\nof not taking care of the others,\nthus leaving behind thousands\nof human beings, or entire populations,\non the side of the road.\nFortunately, there are also those\nwho are creating a new world\nby taking care of the other,\neven out of their own pockets.\nMother Teresa actually said:\n\"One cannot love,\nunless it is at their own expense.\"\n\n\n\n10:26\n\n\nWe have so much to do,\nand we must do it together.\nBut how can we do that\nwith all the evil we breathe every day?\nThank God,\nno system can nullify our desire\nto open up to the good,\nto compassion and to our capacity\nto react against evil,\nall of which stem\nfrom deep within our hearts.\nNow you might tell me,\n\"Sure, these are beautiful words,\nbut I am not the Good Samaritan,\nnor Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\"\nOn the contrary: we are precious,\neach and every one of us.\nEach and every one of us\nis irreplaceable in the eyes of God.\nThrough the darkness of today's conflicts,\neach and every one of us\ncan become a bright candle,\na reminder that light\nwill overcome darkness,\nand never the other way around.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nTo Christians,\nthe future does have a name,\nand its name is Hope.\nFeeling hopeful does not mean\nto be optimistically naïve\nand ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.\nHope is the virtue of a heart\nthat doesn't lock itself into darkness,\nthat doesn't dwell on the past,\ndoes not simply get by in the present,\nbut is able to see a tomorrow.\nHope is the door\nthat opens onto the future.\nHope is a humble, hidden seed of life\nthat, with time,\nwill develop into a large tree.\nIt is like some invisible yeast\nthat allows the whole dough to grow,\nthat brings flavor to all aspects of life.\nAnd it can do so much,\nbecause a tiny flicker of light\nthat feeds on hope\nis enough to shatter\nthe shield of darkness.\nA single individual\nis enough for hope to exist,\nand that individual can be you.\nAnd then there will be another \"you,\"\nand another \"you,\"\nand it turns into an \"us.\"\nAnd so, does hope begin\nwhen we have an \"us?\"\nNo.\nHope began with one \"you.\"\nWhen there is an \"us,\"\nthere begins a revolution.\n\n\n\n13:16\n\n\nThe third message\nI would like to share today\nis, indeed, about revolution:\nthe revolution of tenderness.\nAnd what is tenderness?\nIt is the love that comes close\nand becomes real.\nIt is a movement\nthat starts from our heart\nand reaches the eyes,\nthe ears and the hands.\nTenderness means to use\nour eyes to see the other,\nour ears to hear the other,\nto listen to the children, the poor,\nthose who are afraid of the future.\nTo listen also to the silent cry\nof our common home,\nof our sick and polluted earth.\nTenderness means to use\nour hands and our heart\nto comfort the other,\nto take care of those in need.\n\n\n\n14:13\n\n\nTenderness is the language\nof the young children,\nof those who need the other.\nA child’s love for mom and dad\ngrows through their touch, their gaze,\ntheir voice, their tenderness.\nI like when I hear parents\ntalk to their babies,\nadapting to the little child,\nsharing the same level of communication.\nThis is tenderness:\nbeing on the same level as the other.\nGod himself descended into Jesus\nto be on our level.\nThis is the same path\nthe Good Samaritan took.\nThis is the path that Jesus himself took.\nHe lowered himself,\nhe lived his entire human existence\npracticing the real,\nconcrete language of love.\n\n\n\n15:23\n\n\nYes, tenderness is the path of choice\nfor the strongest,\nmost courageous men and women.\nTenderness is not weakness;\nit is fortitude.\nIt is the path of solidarity,\nthe path of humility.\nPlease, allow me to say it loud and clear:\nthe more powerful you are,\nthe more your actions\nwill have an impact on people,\nthe more responsible you are\nto act humbly.\nIf you don’t, your power will ruin you,\nand you will ruin the other.\nThere is a saying in Argentina:\n\"Power is like drinking gin\non an empty stomach.\"\nYou feel dizzy, you get drunk,\nyou lose your balance,\nand you will end up hurting yourself\nand those around you,\nif you don’t connect your power\nwith humility and tenderness.\nThrough humility and concrete love,\non the other hand,\npower – the highest, the strongest one –\nbecomes a service, a force for good.\n\n\n\n16:52\n\n\nThe future of humankind isn't exclusively\nin the hands of politicians,\nof great leaders, of big companies.\nYes, they do hold\nan enormous responsibility.\nBut the future is, most of all,\nin the hands of those people\nwho recognize the other as a \"you\"\nand themselves as part of an \"us.\"\nWe all need each other.\nAnd so, please, think of me\nas well with tenderness,\nso that I can fulfill the task\nI have been given\nfor the good of the other,\nof each and every one, of all of you,\nof all of us.\nThank you.\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nWhen people find out\nI write about time management,\nthey assume two things.\nOne is that I'm always on time,\nand I'm not.\nI have four small children,\nand I would like to blame them\nfor my occasional tardiness,\nbut sometimes it's just not their fault.\nI was once late to my own speech\non time management.\n\n\n\n 0:34\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 0:35\n\n\nWe all had to just take a moment\ntogether and savor that irony.\n\n\n\n 0:39\n\n\nThe second thing they assume\nis that I have lots of tips and tricks\nfor saving bits of time here and there.\nSometimes I'll hear from magazines\nthat are doing a story along these lines,\ngenerally on how to help their readers\nfind an extra hour in the day.\nAnd the idea is that we'll shave\nbits of time off everyday activities,\nadd it up,\nand we'll have time for the good stuff.\nI question the entire premise\nof this piece, but I'm always interested\nin hearing what they've come\nup with before they call me.\nSome of my favorites:\ndoing errands where you only\nhave to make right-hand turns —\n\n\n\n 1:09\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:10\n\n\nBeing extremely judicious\nin microwave usage:\nit says three to three-and-a-half\nminutes on the package,\nwe're totally getting in on\nthe bottom side of that.\nAnd my personal favorite,\nwhich makes sense on some level,\nis to DVR your favorite shows so you can\nfast-forward through the commercials.\nThat way, you save\neight minutes every half hour,\nso in the course of two hours\nof watching TV,\nyou find 32 minutes to exercise.\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:31\n\n\nWhich is true.\nYou know another way to find\n32 minutes to exercise?\nDon't watch two hours of TV a day, right?\n\n\n\n 1:38\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:40\n\n\nAnyway, the idea is we'll save bits\nof time here and there, add it up,\nwe will finally get\nto everything we want to do.\nBut after studying how successful\npeople spend their time\nand looking at their\nschedules hour by hour,\nI think this idea\nhas it completely backward.\nWe don't build the lives\nwe want by saving time.\nWe build the lives we want,\nand then time saves itself.\n\n\n\n 2:06\n\n\nHere's what I mean.\nI recently did a time diary project\nlooking at 1,001 days in the lives\nof extremely busy women.\nThey had demanding jobs,\nsometimes their own businesses,\nkids to care for,\nmaybe parents to care for,\ncommunity commitments —\nbusy, busy people.\nI had them keep track\nof their time for a week\nso I could add up how much\nthey worked and slept,\nand I interviewed them\nabout their strategies, for my book.\n\n\n\n 2:29\n\n\nOne of the women whose time log I studied\ngoes out on a Wednesday night\nfor something.\nShe comes home to find\nthat her water heater has broken,\nand there is now water\nall over her basement.\nIf you've ever had anything\nlike this happen to you,\nyou know it is a hugely damaging,\nfrightening, sopping mess.\nSo she's dealing with the immediate\naftermath that night,\nnext day she's got plumbers coming in,\nday after that, professional cleaning\ncrew dealing with the ruined carpet.\nAll this is being recorded\non her time log.\nWinds up taking seven hours of her week.\nSeven hours.\nThat's like finding\nan extra hour in the day.\n\n\n\n 3:03\n\n\nBut I'm sure if you had asked her\nat the start of the week,\n\"Could you find seven hours\nto train for a triathlon?\"\n\"Could you find seven hours\nto mentor seven worthy people?\"\nI'm sure she would've said\nwhat most of us would've said,\nwhich is, \"No — can't you see\nhow busy I am?\"\nYet when she had to find seven hours\nbecause there is water\nall over her basement,\nshe found seven hours.\nAnd what this shows us\nis that time is highly elastic.\nWe cannot make more time,\nbut time will stretch to accommodate\nwhat we choose to put into it.\n\n\n\n 3:41\n\n\nAnd so the key to time management\nis treating our priorities\nas the equivalent\nof that broken water heater.\nTo get at this,\nI like to use language from one\nof the busiest people I ever interviewed.\nBy busy, I mean she was running\na small business\nwith 12 people on the payroll,\nshe had six children in her spare time.\nI was getting in touch with her\nto set up an interview\non how she \"had it all\" — that phrase.\nI remember it was a Thursday morning,\nand she was not available\nto speak with me.\nOf course, right?\n\n\n\n 4:11\n\n\nBut the reason she was\nunavailable to speak with me\nis that she was out for a hike,\nbecause it was a beautiful spring morning,\nand she wanted to go for a hike.\nSo of course this makes me\neven more intrigued,\nand when I finally do catch up with her,\nshe explains it like this.\nShe says, \"Listen Laura, everything I do,\nevery minute I spend, is my choice.\"\nAnd rather than say,\n\"I don't have time to do x, y or z,\"\nshe'd say, \"I don't do x, y or z\nbecause it's not a priority.\"\n\"I don't have time,\" often means\n\"It's not a priority.\"\nIf you think about it,\nthat's really more accurate language.\nI could tell you I don't have time\nto dust my blinds,\nbut that's not true.\nIf you offered to pay me $100,000\nto dust my blinds,\nI would get to it pretty quickly.\n\n\n\n 4:58\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 4:59\n\n\nSince that is not going to happen,\nI can acknowledge this is not\na matter of lacking time;\nit's that I don't want to do it.\nUsing this language reminds us\nthat time is a choice.\nAnd granted,\nthere may be horrible consequences\nfor making different choices,\nI will give you that.\nBut we are smart people,\nand certainly over the long run,\nwe have the power to fill our lives\nwith the things that deserve to be there.\n\n\n\n 5:24\n\n\nSo how do we do that?\nHow do we treat our priorities\nas the equivalent\nof that broken water heater?\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nWell, first we need\nto figure out what they are.\nI want to give you two strategies\nfor thinking about this.\nThe first, on the professional side:\nI'm sure many people\ncoming up to the end of the year\nare giving or getting\nannual performance reviews.\nYou look back over\nyour successes over the year,\nyour \"opportunities for growth.\"\nAnd this serves its purpose,\nbut I find it's more effective\nto do this looking forward.\nSo I want you to pretend\nit's the end of next year.\nYou're giving yourself\na performance review,\nand it has been an absolutely\namazing year for you professionally.\nWhat three to five things did you do\nthat made it so amazing?\nSo you can write next\nyear's performance review now.\n\n\n\n 6:13\n\n\nAnd you can do this\nfor your personal life, too.\nI'm sure many of you,\nlike me, come December,\nget cards that contain these folded up\nsheets of colored paper,\non which is written what is known\nas the family holiday letter.\n\n\n\n 6:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:29\n\n\nBit of a wretched genre\nof literature, really,\ngoing on about how amazing\neveryone in the household is,\nor even more scintillating,\nhow busy everyone in the household is.\nBut these letters serve a purpose,\nwhich is that they tell\nyour friends and family\nwhat you did in your personal life\nthat mattered to you over the year.\nSo this year's kind of done,\nbut I want you to pretend\nit's the end of next year,\nand it has been an absolutely amazing year\nfor you and the people you care about.\nWhat three to five things did you do\nthat made it so amazing?\nSo you can write next\nyear's family holiday letter now.\nDon't send it.\n\n\n\n 7:08\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 7:09\n\n\nPlease, don't send it.\nBut you can write it.\nAnd now, between the performance\nreview and the family holiday letter,\nwe have a list of six to ten goals\nwe can work on in the next year.\n\n\n\n 7:20\n\n\nAnd now we need to break\nthese down into doable steps.\nSo maybe you want\nto write a family history.\nFirst, you can read\nsome other family histories,\nget a sense for the style.\nThen maybe think about the questions\nyou want to ask your relatives,\nset up appointments to interview them.\nOr maybe you want to run a 5K.\nSo you need to find a race and sign up,\nfigure out a training plan,\nand dig those shoes\nout of the back of the closet.\nAnd then — this is key —\nwe treat our priorities as the equivalent\nof that broken water heater,\nby putting them into our schedules first.\nWe do this by thinking through our weeks\nbefore we are in them.\n\n\n\n 7:55\n\n\nI find a really good time to do this\nis Friday afternoons.\nFriday afternoon is what\nan economist might call\na \"low opportunity cost\" time.\nMost of us are not sitting there\non Friday afternoons saying,\n\"I am excited to make progress\ntoward my personal\nand professional priorities\nright now.\"\n\n\n\n 8:14\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:15\n\n\nBut we are willing to think\nabout what those should be.\nSo take a little bit\nof time Friday afternoon,\nmake yourself a three-category priority\nlist: career, relationships, self.\nMaking a three-category list reminds us\nthat there should be something\nin all three categories.\nCareer, we think about;\nrelationships, self —\nnot so much.\nBut anyway, just a short list,\ntwo to three items in each.\nThen look out over the whole\nof the next week,\nand see where you can plan them in.\n\n\n\n 8:47\n\n\nWhere you plan them in is up to you.\nI know this is going to be more\ncomplicated for some people than others.\nI mean, some people's lives\nare just harder than others.\nIt is not going to be easy\nto find time to take that poetry class\nif you are caring for multiple\nchildren on your own.\nI get that.\nAnd I don't want to minimize\nanyone's struggle.\nBut I do think that the numbers\nI am about to tell you are empowering.\n\n\n\n 9:11\n\n\nThere are 168 hours in a week.\nTwenty-four times seven is 168 hours.\nThat is a lot of time.\nIf you are working a full-time\njob, so 40 hours a week,\nsleeping eight hours a night,\nso 56 hours a week —\nthat leaves 72 hours for other things.\nThat is a lot of time.\nYou say you're working 50 hours a week,\nmaybe a main job and a side hustle.\nWell, that leaves 62 hours\nfor other things.\nYou say you're working 60 hours.\nWell, that leaves 52 hours\nfor other things.\nYou say you're working more than 60 hours.\nWell, are you sure?\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:54\n\n\nThere was once a study comparing\npeople's estimated work weeks\nwith time diaries.\nThey found that people claiming\n75-plus-hour work weeks\nwere off by about 25 hours.\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nYou can guess in which direction, right?\nAnyway, in 168 hours a week,\nI think we can find time\nfor what matters to you.\nIf you want to spend\nmore time with your kids,\nyou want to study more\nfor a test you're taking,\nyou want to exercise for three hours\nand volunteer for two,\nyou can.\nAnd that's even if you're working\nway more than full-time hours.\n\n\n\n10:26\n\n\nSo we have plenty of time, which is great,\nbecause guess what?\nWe don't even need that much\ntime to do amazing things.\nBut when most of us have\nbits of time, what do we do?\nPull out the phone, right?\nStart deleting emails.\nOtherwise, we're puttering\naround the house\nor watching TV.\n\n\n\n10:45\n\n\nBut small moments can have great power.\nYou can use your bits of time\nfor bits of joy.\nMaybe it's choosing to read\nsomething wonderful on the bus\non the way to work.\nI know when I had a job\nthat required two bus rides\nand a subway ride every morning,\nI used to go to the library\non weekends to get stuff to read.\nIt made the whole experience\nalmost, almost, enjoyable.\nBreaks at work can be used\nfor meditating or praying.\nIf family dinner is out\nbecause of your crazy work schedule,\nmaybe family breakfast\ncould be a good substitute.\n\n\n\n11:20\n\n\nIt's about looking at\nthe whole of one's time\nand seeing where the good stuff can go.\nI truly believe this.\nThere is time.\nEven if we are busy,\nwe have time for what matters.\nAnd when we focus on what matters,\nwe can build the lives we want\nin the time we've got.\n\n\n\n11:45\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:46\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI come to you today to speak of liars,\nlawsuits\nand laughter.\nThe first time I heard\nabout Holocaust denial,\nI laughed.\nHolocaust denial?\nThe Holocaust which has\nthe dubious distinction\nof being the best-documented\ngenocide in the world?\nWho could believe it didn't happen?\n\n\n\n 0:39\n\n\nThink about it.\nFor deniers to be right,\nwho would have to be wrong?\nWell, first of all, the victims —\nthe survivors who have told us\ntheir harrowing stories.\nWho else would have to be wrong?\nThe bystanders.\nThe people who lived in the myriads\nof towns and villages and cities\non the Eastern front,\nwho watched their neighbors\nbe rounded up —\nmen, women, children, young, old —\nand be marched\nto the outskirts of the town\nto be shot and left dead in ditches.\nOr the Poles,\nwho lived in towns and villages\naround the death camps,\nwho watched day after day\nas the trains went in filled with people\nand came out empty.\n\n\n\n 1:30\n\n\nBut above all, who would have to be wrong?\nThe perpetrators.\nThe people who say, \"We did it.\nI did it.\"\nNow, maybe they add a caveat.\nThey say, \"I didn't have a choice;\nI was forced to do it.\"\nBut nonetheless, they say, \"I did it.\"\nThink about it.\nIn not one war crimes trial\nsince the end of World War II\nhas a perpetrator of any nationality\never said, \"It didn't happen.\"\nAgain, they may have said, \"I was forced,\"\nbut never that it didn't happen.\nHaving thought that through,\nI decided denial was not\ngoing to be on my agenda;\nI had bigger things to worry about,\nto write about, to research,\nand I moved on.\n\n\n\n 2:23\n\n\nFast-forward a little over a decade,\nand two senior scholars —\ntwo of the most prominent historians\nof the Holocaust —\napproached me and said,\n\"Deborah, let's have coffee.\nWe have a research idea\nthat we think is perfect for you.\"\nIntrigued and flattered\nthat they came to me with an idea\nand thought me worthy of it,\nI asked, \"What is it?\"\nAnd they said, \"Holocaust denial.\"\nAnd for the second time, I laughed.\nHolocaust denial?\nThe Flat Earth folks?\nThe Elvis-is-alive people?\nI should study them?\nAnd these two guys said,\n\"Yeah, we're intrigued.\nWhat are they about?\nWhat's their objective?\nHow do they manage to get people\nto believe what they say?\"\n\n\n\n 3:13\n\n\nSo thinking, if they thought\nit was worthwhile,\nI would take a momentary diversion —\nmaybe a year, maybe two,\nthree, maybe even four —\nin academic terms, that's momentary.\n\n\n\n 3:25\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\nWe work very slowly.\n\n\n\n 3:29\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:31\n\n\nAnd I would look at them.\nSo I did.\nI did my research, and I came up\nwith a number of things,\ntwo of which I'd like to share\nwith you today.\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\nOne:\ndeniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.\nThey are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis —\nyou can decide whether you want\nto put a \"neo\" there or not.\nBut when I looked at them,\nI didn't see any SS-like uniforms,\nswastika-like symbols on the wall,\nSieg Heil salutes —\nnone of that.\nWhat I found instead\nwere people parading\nas respectable academics.\n\n\n\n 4:15\n\n\nWhat did they have?\nThey had an institute.\nAn \"Institute for Historical Review.\"\nThey had a journal — a slick journal —\na \"Journal of Historical Review.\"\nOne filled with papers —\nfootnote-laden papers.\nAnd they had a new name.\nNot neo-Nazis,\nnot anti-Semites —\nrevisionists.\nThey said, \"We are revisionists.\nWe are out to do one thing:\nto revise mistakes in history.\"\nBut all you had to do was go\none inch below the surface,\nand what did you find there?\nThe same adulation of Hitler,\npraise of the Third Reich,\nanti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.\nThis is what intrigued me.\nIt was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,\nparading as rational discourse.\n\n\n\n 5:19\n\n\nThe other thing I found —\nmany of us have been taught to think\nthere are facts and there are opinions —\nafter studying deniers,\nI think differently.\nThere are facts,\nthere are opinions,\nand there are lies.\nAnd what deniers want to do\nis take their lies,\ndress them up as opinions —\nmaybe edgy opinions,\nmaybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions —\nbut then if they're opinions,\nthey should be part of the conversation.\nAnd then they encroach on the facts.\n\n\n\n 5:54\n\n\nI published my work —\nthe book was published,\n\"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing\nAssault on Truth and Memory,\"\nit came out in many different countries,\nincluding here in Penguin UK,\nand I was done with those folks\nand ready to move on.\nThen came the letter from Penguin UK.\nAnd for the third time, I laughed ...\nmistakenly.\nI opened the letter,\nand it informed me that David Irving\nwas bringing a libel suit against me\nin the United Kingdom\nfor calling him a Holocaust denier.\n\n\n\n 6:32\n\n\nDavid Irving suing me?\nWho was David Irving?\nDavid Irving was a writer\nof historical works,\nmost of them about World War II,\nand virtually all of those works\ntook the position\nthat the Nazis were really not so bad,\nand the Allies were really not so good.\nAnd the Jews, whatever happened to them,\nthey sort of deserved it.\nHe knew the documents,\nhe knew the facts,\nbut he somehow twisted them\nto get this opinion.\nHe hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,\nbut in the late '80s,\nhe embraced it with great vigor.\n\n\n\n 7:10\n\n\nThe reason I laughed also\nwas this was a man\nwho not only was a Holocaust denier,\nbut seemed quite proud of it.\nHere was a man — and I quote —\nwho said, \"I'm going to sink\nthe battleship Auschwitz.\"\nHere was a man\nwho pointed to the number tattooed\non a survivor's arm and said,\n\"How much money have you made\nfrom having that number\ntattooed on your arm?\"\nHere was a man who said,\n\"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car\nat Chappaquiddick\nthan died in gas chambers at Auschwitz.\"\nThat's an American reference,\nbut you can look it up.\nThis was not a man who seemed\nat all ashamed or reticent\nabout being a Holocaust denier.\n\n\n\n 7:56\n\n\nNow, lots of my academic\ncolleagues counseled me —\n\"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it.\"\nWhen I explained you can't just\nignore a libel suit,\nthey said, \"Who's going to\nbelieve him anyway?\"\nBut here was the problem:\nBritish law put the onus,\nput the burden of proof on me\nto prove the truth of what I said,\nin contrast to as it would have\nbeen in the United States\nand in many other countries:\non him to prove the falsehood.\n\n\n\n 8:26\n\n\nWhat did that mean?\nThat meant if I didn't fight,\nhe would win by default.\nAnd if he won by default,\nhe could then legitimately say,\n\"My David Irving version of the Holocaust\nis a legitimate version.\nDeborah Lipstadt was found\nto have libeled me\nwhen she called me a Holocaust denier.\nIpso facto, I, David Irving,\nam not a Holocaust denier.\"\nAnd what is that version?\nThere was no plan to murder the Jews,\nthere were no gas chambers,\nthere were no mass shootings,\nHitler had nothing to do\nwith any suffering that went on,\nand the Jews have made this all up\nto get money from Germany\nand to get a state,\nand they've done it with the aid\nand abettance of the Allies —\nthey've planted the documents\nand planted the evidence.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nI couldn't let that stand\nand ever face a survivor\nor a child of survivors.\nI couldn't let that stand\nand consider myself\na responsible historian.\nSo we fought.\nAnd for those of you\nwho haven't seen \"Denial,\"\nspoiler alert:\nwe won.\n\n\n\n 9:42\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 9:44\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:50\n\n\nThe judge found David Irving\nto be a liar,\na racist,\nan anti-Semite.\nHis view of history was tendentious,\nhe lied, he distorted —\nand most importantly,\nhe did it deliberately.\nWe showed a pattern,\nin over 25 different major instances.\nNot small things — many of us\nin this audience write books,\nare writing books;\nwe always make mistakes, that's why\nwe're glad to have second editions:\ncorrect the mistakes.\n\n\n\n10:23\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:25\n\n\nBut these always moved\nin the same direction:\nblame the Jews,\nexonerate the Nazis.\n\n\n\n10:34\n\n\nBut how did we win?\nWhat we did is follow his footnotes\nback to his sources.\nAnd what did we find?\nNot in most cases,\nand not in the preponderance of cases,\nbut in every single instance where\nhe made some reference to the Holocaust,\nthat his supposed evidence was distorted,\nhalf-truth,\ndate-changed,\nsequence-changed,\nsomeone put at a meeting who wasn't there.\nIn other words,\nhe didn't have the evidence.\nHis evidence didn't prove it.\nWe didn't prove what happened.\nWe proved that what he said happened —\nand by extension, all deniers,\nbecause he either quotes them\nor they get their arguments from him —\nis not true.\nWhat they claim —\nthey don't have the evidence to prove it.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\n\nSo why is my story\nmore than just the story\nof a quirky, long,\nsix-year, difficult lawsuit,\nan American professor\nbeing dragged into a courtroom\nby a man that the court\ndeclared in its judgment\nwas a neo-Nazi polemicist?\nWhat message does it have?\nI think in the context\nof the question of truth,\nit has a very significant message.\nBecause today,\nas we well know,\ntruth and facts are under assault.\nSocial media, for all\nthe gifts it has given us,\nhas also allowed the difference\nbetween facts — established facts —\nand lies\nto be flattened.\n\n\n\n12:15\n\n\nThird of all:\nextremism.\nYou may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,\nyou may not see burning crosses,\nyou may not even hear outright\nwhite supremacist language.\nIt may go by names: \"alt-right,\"\n\"National Front\" — pick your names.\nBut underneath, it's that same extremism\nthat I found in Holocaust denial\nparading as rational discourse.\n\n\n\n12:46\n\n\nWe live in an age\nwhere truth is on the defensive.\nI'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.\nA quiz show recently appeared\nin \"The New Yorker\"\nwhere the host of the quiz show\nis saying to one of the contestants,\n\"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.\nBut your opponent yelled\nmore loudly than you did,\nso he gets the point.\"\n\n\n\n13:07\n\n\nWhat can we do?\nFirst of all,\nwe cannot be beguiled\nby rational appearances.\nWe've got to look underneath,\nand we will find there the extremism.\nSecond of all,\nwe must understand\nthat truth is not relative.\nNumber three,\nwe must go on the offensive,\nnot the defensive.\nWhen someone makes an outrageous claim,\neven though they may hold\none of the highest offices in the land,\nif not the world —\nwe must say to them,\n\"Where's the proof?\nWhere's the evidence?\"\nWe must hold their feet to the fire.\nWe must not treat it as if their lies\nare the same as the facts.\n\n\n\n14:02\n\n\nAnd as I said earlier,\ntruth is not relative.\nMany of us have grown up\nin the world of the academy\nand enlightened liberal thought,\nwhere we're taught\neverything is open to debate.\nBut that's not the case.\nThere are certain things that are true.\nThere are indisputable facts —\nobjective truths.\nGalileo taught it to us centuries ago.\nEven after being forced\nto recant by the Vatican\nthat the Earth moved around the Sun,\nhe came out,\nand what is he reported to have said?\n\"And yet, it still moves.\"\n\n\n\n14:46\n\n\nThe Earth is not flat.\nThe climate is changing.\nElvis is not alive.\n\n\n\n14:54\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:56\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n14:58\n\n\nAnd most importantly,\ntruth and fact are under assault.\nThe job ahead of us,\nthe task ahead of us,\nthe challenge ahead of us\nis great.\nThe time to fight is short.\nWe must act now.\nLater will be too late.\n\n\n\n15:23\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n15:24\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:13\n\n\nI'm going to present\nthree projects in rapid fire.\nI don't have much time to do it.\nAnd I want to reinforce three ideas\nwith that rapid-fire presentation.\n\n\n\n 0:20\n\n\nThe first is what I like to call\na hyper-rational process.\nIt's a process that takes rationality\nalmost to an absurd level,\nand it transcends all the baggage\nthat normally comes\nwith what people would call,\nsort of a rational\nconclusion to something.\nAnd it concludes in something\nthat you see here,\nthat you actually wouldn't expect\nas being the result of rationality.\n\n\n\n 0:41\n\n\nThe second —\nthe second is that this process\ndoes not have a signature.\nThere is no authorship.\nArchitects are obsessed with authorship.\nThis is something that has\nediting and it has teams,\nbut in fact, we no longer\nsee within this process,\nthe traditional master architect\ncreating a sketch\nthat his minions carry out.\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nAnd the third is that it challenges —\nand this is, in the length of this,\nvery hard to support why,\nconnect all these things —\nbut it challenges the high modernist\nnotion of flexibility.\nHigh modernists said we will create\nsort of singular spaces that are generic,\nalmost anything can happen within them.\nI call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" —\nturn your head this way; shoot;\nand you're bound to kill something.\nSo, this is the promise of high modernism:\nwithin a single space, actually,\nany kind of activity can happen.\nBut as we're seeing,\noperational costs are starting\nto dwarf capital costs\nin terms of design parameters.\nAnd so, with this sort of idea,\nwhat happens is, whatever actually\nis in the building on opening day,\nor whatever seems to be\nthe most immediate need,\nstarts to dwarf the possibility\nand sort of subsume it,\nof anything else could ever happen.\nAnd so we're proposing\na different kind of flexibility,\nsomething that we call\n\"compartmentalized flexibility.\"\nAnd the idea is that you,\nwithin that continuum,\nidentify a series of points,\nand you design specifically to them.\nThey can be pushed\noff-center a little bit,\nbut in the end you actually\nstill get as much\nof that original spectrum\nas you originally had hoped.\nWith high modernist flexibility,\nthat doesn't really work.\n\n\n\n 2:11\n\n\nNow I'm going to talk about —\nI'm going to build up\nthe Seattle Central Library\nin this way before your eyes\nin about five or six diagrams,\nand I truly mean this is the design\nprocess that you'll see.\nWith the library staff\nand the library board,\nwe settled on two core positions.\nThis is the first one, and this\nis showing, over the last 900 years,\nthe evolution of the book,\nand other technologies.\nThis diagram was our sort\nof position piece about the book,\nand our position was,\nbooks are technology —\nthat's something people forget —\nbut it's a form of technology\nthat will have to share its dominance\nwith any other form of truly potent\ntechnology or media.\n\n\n\n 2:46\n\n\nThe second premise —\nand this was something\nthat was very difficult for us\nto convince the librarians of at first —\nis that libraries, since the inception\nof Carnegie Library tradition in America,\nhad a second responsibility,\nand that was for social roles.\nOk, now, this I'll come back\nto later, but something —\nactually, the librarians at first said,\n\"No, this isn't our mandate.\nOur mandate is media,\nand particularly the book.\"\n\n\n\n 3:08\n\n\nSo what you're seeing now\nis actually the design of the building.\nThe upper diagram is what we had seen\nin a whole host of contemporary libraries\nthat used high modernist flexibility.\nSort of, any activity\ncould happen anywhere.\nWe don't know the future of the library;\nwe don't know the future of the book;\nand so, we'll use this approach.\n\n\n\n 3:27\n\n\nAnd what we saw were buildings\nthat were very generic, and worse —\nnot only were they very generic —\nso, not only does the reading room\nlook like the copy room\nlook like the magazine area —\nbut it meant that whatever issue\nwas troubling the library at that moment\nwas starting to engulf every other\nactivity that was happening in it.\nAnd in this case,\nwhat was getting engulfed\nwere these social responsibilities\nby the expansion of the book.\nAnd so we proposed\nwhat's at the lower diagram.\nVery dumb approach:\nsimply compartmentalize.\nPut those things whose evolution\nwe could predict —\nand I don't mean that we could say\nwhat would actually happen in the future,\nbut we have some certainty of the spectrum\nof what would happen in the future —\nput those in boxes designed\nspecifically for it,\nand put the things that we can't\npredict on the rooftops.\nSo that was the core idea.\n\n\n\n 4:10\n\n\nNow, we had to convince the library\nthat social roles were\nequally important to media,\nin order to get them to accept this.\nWhat you're seeing here is actually\ntheir program on the left.\nThat's as it was given to us\nin all of its clarity and glory.\nOur first operation was to re-digest it\nback to them, show it to them and say,\n\"You know what? We haven't touched it,\nbut only one-third of your own program\nis dedicated to media and books.\nTwo-thirds of it is already dedicated —\nthat's the white band below,\nthe thing you said isn't important —\nis already dedicated to social functions.\"\nSo once we had presented\nthat back to them,\nthey agreed that this sort\nof core concept could work.\nWe got the right to go back\nto first principles —\nthat's the third diagram.\nWe recombined everything.\nAnd then we started making new decisions.\n\n\n\n 4:53\n\n\nWhat you're seeing on the right\nis the design of the library,\nspecifically in terms of square footage.\nOn the left of that diagram, here,\nyou'll see a series of five platforms —\nsort of combs, collective programs.\nAnd on the right are the more\nindeterminate spaces;\nthings like reading rooms,\nwhose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years\nwe can't predict.\nSo that literally was the design\nof the building.\nThey signed it, and to their chagrin,\nwe came back a week later,\nand we presented them this.\nAnd as you can see, it is literally\nthe diagram on the right.\n\n\n\n 5:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:22\n\n\nWe just sized — no, really,\nI mean that, literally.\nThe things on the left-hand side\nof the diagram,\nthose are the boxes.\nWe sized them into five compartments.\nThey're super-efficient.\nWe had a very low budget to work with.\nWe pushed them around on the site\nto make very literal\ncontextual relationships.\nThe reading room\nshould be able to see the water.\nThe main entrance should have\na public plaza in front of it\nto abide by the zoning code, and so forth.\n\n\n\n 5:45\n\n\nSo, you see the five platforms,\nthose are the boxes.\nwithin each one, a very discrete\nthing is happening.\nThe area in between\nis sort of an urban continuum,\nthese things that we can't predict\ntheir evolution to the same degree.\nTo give you some sense\nof the power of this idea,\nthe biggest block\nis what we call the book spiral.\nIt's literally built\nin a very inexpensive way —\nit is a parking garage for books.\nIt just so happens to be on the 6th\nthrough 10th floors of the building,\nbut that is not necessarily\nan expensive approach.\nAnd it allows us to organize\nthe entire Dewey Decimal System\non one continuous run; no matter how it\ngrows or contracts within the building,\nit will always have its clarity\nto end the sort of trail of tears\nthat we've all experienced\nin public libraries.\n\n\n\n 6:27\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:29\n\n\nAnd so this was the final operation,\nwhich was to take these blocks\nas they were all pushed off kilter,\nand to hold onto them with a skin.\nThat skin serves double duty,\nagain, for economics.\nOne, it is the lateral stability\nfor the entire building;\nit's a structural element.\nBut its dimensions were designed\nnot only for structure,\nbut also for holding on\nevery piece of glass.\nThe glass was then —\nI'll use the word impregnated —\nbut it had a layer of metal\nthat was called \"stretched metal.\"\nThat metal acts as a microlouver,\nso from the exterior of the building,\nthe sun sees it as totally opaque,\nbut from the interior,\nit's entirely transparent.\n\n\n\n 7:02\n\n\nSo now I'm going to take you\non a tour of the building.\nLet me see if I can find it.\nFor anyone who gets\nmotion sickness, I apologize.\nSo, this is the building.\nAnd I think what's important is,\nwhen we first unveiled the building,\nthe public saw it as being\ntotally about our whim and ego.\nAnd it was defended,\nbelieve it or not, by the librarians.\nThey said, \"Look,\nwe don't know what it is,\nbut we know it's everything\nthat we need it to be,\nbased on the observations\nthat we've done about the program.\"\nThis is going into one of the entries.\nSo, it's an unusual building\nfor a public library, obviously.\n\n\n\n 7:45\n\n\nSo now we're going\ninto what we call the living room.\nThis is actually a program\nthat we invented with the library.\nIt was recognizing that public libraries\nare the last vestige of public free space.\nThere are plenty of shopping malls\nthat allow you to get out of the rain\nin downtown Seattle,\nbut there are not so many free places\nthat allow you to get out of the rain.\nSo this was an unprogrammed area where\npeople could pretty much do anything,\nincluding eat, yell,\nplay chess and so forth.\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nNow we're moving up into what we call\nthe mixing chamber.\nThat was the main\ntechnology area in the building.\nYou'll have to tell me\nif I'm going too fast for you.\nAnd now up.\nThis is actually the place\nthat we put into the building\nso I could propose\nto my wife, right there.\n\n\n\n 8:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:39\n\n\nShe said yes.\n\n\n\n 8:40\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:43\n\n\nI'm running out of time,\nso I'm actually going to stop.\nI can show this to you later.\nBut let's see if I can very quickly\nget into the book spiral,\nbecause I think it's,\nas I said, the most —\nthis is the main reading room —\nthe most unique part of the building.\nYou dizzy yet?\nOk, so here, this is the book spiral.\nSo, it's very indiscernible,\nbut it's actually\na continuous stair-stepping.\nIt allows you to, on one city block,\ngo up one full floor,\nso that it's on a continuum.\n\n\n\n 9:22\n\n\nOk, now I'm going to go back,\nand I'm going to hit a second project.\nI'm going to go very,\nvery quickly through this.\nNow this is the Dallas Theater.\nIt was an unusual client for us,\nbecause they came to us and they said,\n\"We need you to do a new building.\nWe've been working\nin a temporary space for 30 years,\nbut because of that temporary space,\nwe've become an infamous theater company.\nTheater is really focused in New York,\nChicago and Seattle,\nwith the exception\nof the Dallas Theater Company.\"\nAnd the very fact that they worked\nin a provisional space\nmeant that for Beckett,\nthey could blow out a wall;\nthey could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow\na hole through the floor, and so forth.\n\n\n\n 9:58\n\n\nSo it was a very daunting task\nfor us to do a brand-new building\nthat could be a pristine building,\nbut keep this kind of experimental nature.\nAnd the second is,\nthey were what we call\na multi-form theater,\nthey do different kinds\nof performances in repertory.\nSo they in the morning\nwill do something in arena,\nthen they'll do something\nin proscenium and so forth.\nAnd so they needed to be able\nto quickly transform\nbetween different theater organizations,\nand for operational budget reasons,\nthis actually no longer\nhappens in pretty much\nany multi-form theater\nin the United States,\nso we needed to figure out\na way to overcome that.\n\n\n\n10:30\n\n\nSo our thought was to literally\nput the theater on its head:\nto take those things\nthat were previously defined\nas front-of-house and back-of-house\nand stack them above house\nand below house,\nand to create what we called\na theater machine.\nWe invest the money\nin the operation of the building.\nIt's almost as though the building\ncould be placed anywhere,\nwherever you place it,\nthe area under it is charged\nfor theatrical performances.\nAnd it allowed us to go back\nto first principles,\nand redefine fly tower, acoustic\nenclosure, light enclosure and so forth.\nAnd at the push of a button,\nit allows the artistic director\nto move between proscenium, thrust,\nand in fact, arena\nand traverse and flat floor,\nin a very quick transfiguration.\n\n\n\n11:08\n\n\nSo in fact, using\noperational budget, we can —\nsorry, capital cost —\nwe can actually achieve\nwhat was no longer achievable\nin operational cost.\nAnd that means that the artistic director\nnow has a palette that he or she\ncan choose from,\nbetween a series of forms\nand a series of processions,\nbecause that enclosure around the theater\nthat is normally trapped\nwith front-of-house and back-of-house\nspaces has been liberated.\nSo an artistic director has the ability\nto have a performance\nthat enters in a Wagnerian procession,\nshows the first act in thrust,\nthe intermission in a Greek procession,\nsecond act in arena, and so forth.\n\n\n\n11:44\n\n\nSo I'm going to show you\nwhat this actually means.\nThis is the theater up close.\nAny portion around the theater\nactually can be opened discretely.\nThe light enclosure can be lifted\nseparate to the acoustic enclosure,\nso you can do Beckett\nwith Dallas as the backdrop.\nPortions can be opened,\nso you can now actually have motorcycles\ndrive directly into the performance,\nor you can even just have\nan open-air performance,\nor for intermissions.\nThe balconies all move to go\nbetween those configurations,\nbut they also disappear.\nThe proscenium line can also disappear.\nYou can bring enormous objects in,\nso in fact, the Dallas Theater Company —\ntheir first show will be a play\nabout Charles Lindbergh,\nand they'll want to bring in\na real aircraft.\nAnd then it also provides them,\nin the off-season,\nthe ability to actually rent out\ntheir space for entirely different things.\nThis is it from a distance.\nOpen up entire portions\nfor different kinds of events.\nAnd at night.\nAgain, remove the light enclosure;\nkeep the acoustic enclosure.\nThis is a monster truck show.\n\n\n\n12:52\n\n\nI'm going to show now the last project.\nThis also is an unusual client.\nThey inverted the whole idea\nof development.\nThey came to us and they said —\nunlike normal developers —\nthey said, \"We want to start out\nby providing a contemporary\nart museum in Louisville.\nThat's our main goal.\"\nAnd so instead of being a developer\nthat sees an opportunity to make money,\nthey saw an ability to be\na catalyst in their downtown.\nAnd the fact that they wanted to support\nthe contemporary art museum\nactually built their pro forma,\nso they worked in reverse.\nAnd that pro forma led us\nto a mixed-use building\nthat was very large,\nin order to support\ntheir aspirations of the art,\nbut it also opened up opportunities\nfor the art itself\nto collaborate, interact\nwith commercial spaces\nthat actually artists more\nand more want to work within.\nAnd it also charged us\nwith thinking about how to have\nsomething that was both a single building\nand a credible sort of sub-building.\n\n\n\n13:43\n\n\nSo this is Louisville's skyline,\nand I'm going to take\nyou through the various constraints\nthat led to the project.\nFirst: the physical constraints.\nWe actually had to operate\non three discrete sites,\nall of them well smaller\nthan the size of the building.\nWe had to operate next to the new\nMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it.\nWe had to operate\nwithin the 100-year floodplain.\nNow, this area floods\nthree to four times a year,\nand there's a levee behind our site,\nsimilar to the ones\nthat broke in New Orleans.\nHad to operate behind the I-64 corridor,\na street that cuts through the middle\nof these separate sites.\nSo we're starting to build a sort of\nnightmare of constraints in a bathtub.\nUnderneath the bathtub\nare the city's main power lines.\nAnd there is a pedestrian corridor\nthat they wanted to add,\nthat would link a series\nof cultural buildings,\nand a view corridor —\nbecause this is the historic district —\nthat they didn't want to obstruct\nwith a new building.\n\n\n\n14:37\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n14:38\n\n\nAnd now we're going to add\n1.1 million square feet.\nAnd if we did the traditional thing,\nthat 1.1 million square feet —\nthese are the different programs —\nthe traditional thing would be to identify\nthe public elements, place them on sites,\nand now we'd have a really\nterrible situation:\na public thing in the middle\nof a bathtub that floods.\nAnd then we would size\nall the other elements —\nthe different commercial elements:\nhotel, luxury housing,\noffices and so forth —\nand dump it on top.\nAnd we would create\nsomething that was unviable.\nIn fact — and you know this — this\nis called the Time Warner Building.\n\n\n\n15:10\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n15:12\n\n\nSo our strategy was very simple.\nJust lift the entire block,\nflip some of the elements over,\nreposition them\nso they have appropriate views\nand relationships to downtown,\nand make circulation connections\nand reroute the road.\nSo that's the basic concept,\nand now I'm going to show you\nwhat it leads to.\n\n\n\n15:31\n\n\nOk, it seems a very formal,\nwillful gesture,\nbut something derived entirely\nout of the constraints.\nAnd again, when we unveiled it,\nthere was a sort of nervousness\nthat this was about an architect\nmaking a statement,\nnot an architect who was attempting\nto solve a series of problems.\nNow, within that center zone, as I said,\nwe have the ability to mix\na series of things.\nSo here, this is sort of an x-ray —\nthe towers are totally developer-driven.\nThey told us the dimensions,\nthe sizes and so forth,\nand we focused on taking\nall the public components —\nthe lobbies, the bars —\neverything that different commercial\nelements would have,\nand combined it in the center,\nin the sort of subway map,\nin the transfer zone that would also\ninclude the contemporary art museum.\n\n\n\n16:11\n\n\nSo it creates a situation like this,\nwhere you have artists who can operate\nwithin an art space that also has\nan amazing view on the 22nd floor,\nbut it also has proximity that the curator\ncan either open or close.\nIt allows people\non exercise bicycles to be seen,\nor to see the art, and so forth.\nIt also means that if an artist wants\nto invade something like a swimming pool,\nthey can begin to do their exhibition\nin a swimming pool,\nso they're not forced to always\nwork within the confines\nof a contemporary gallery space.\n\n\n\n16:38\n\n\nSo, how to build this.\nIt's very simple: it's a chair.\nSo, we begin by building the cores.\nAs we're building the cores, we build\nthe contemporary art museum at grade.\nThat allows us to have\nincredible efficiency and cost efficiency.\nThis is not a high-budget building.\nThe moment the cores get to mid level,\nwe finish the art museum; we put\nall the mechanical equipment in it;\nand then we jack it up into the air.\nThis is how they build\nreally large aircraft hangars,\nfor instance, the ones\nthat they did for the A380.\nFinish the cores, finish the meat\nand you get something\nthat looks like this.\n\n\n\n17:09\n\n\nNow I only have about 30 seconds,\nso I want to start an animation,\nand we'll conclude with that.\n\n\n\n17:14\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n17:15\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n17:20\n\n\nChris asked me to add —\nthe theater is under construction,\nand this project will start\nconstruction in about a year,\nand finish in 2010.\n\n\n\n17:27\n\n\n[identify public elements]\n\n\n\n17:29\n\n\n[insert public elements at grade]\n\n\n\n17:30\n\n\n[optimize tower dimensions]\n\n\n\n17:33\n\n\n[place towers on

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nToday, I want to tell you\nabout a pressing social issue.\nNow, it's not nuclear arms,\nit's not immigration,\nand it's not malaria.\nI'm here to talk about movies.\n\n\n\n 0:25\n\n\nNow, in all seriousness,\nmovies are actually really important.\nIn film, we can be wildly entertained,\nand we can also be transported\nthrough storytelling.\nStorytelling is so important.\nStories tell us what societies value,\nthey offer us lessons,\nand they share and preserve our history.\nStories are amazing.\n\n\n\n 0:51\n\n\nBut stories don't give everyone\nthe same opportunity\nto appear within them,\nparticularly not stories\ncompartmentalized\nin the form of American movies.\nIn film, interestingly enough,\nfemales are still erased and marginalized\nin a lot of our stories.\nAnd I learned this for the first time\nabout 10 years ago\nwhen I did my first study\non gender role in G-rated films.\nSince then, we've conducted\nmore than 30 investigations.\nMy team is tired.\nAnd I've committed my life\nas researcher and activist\nto fighting the inclusion crisis\nin Hollywood.\n\n\n\n 1:36\n\n\nSo today, what I'd like to do\nis tell you about that crisis.\nI want to talk about\ngender inequality in film.\nI want to tell you how it is perpetuated,\nand then I'm going to tell you\nhow we're going to fix it.\n\n\n\n 1:48\n\n\nHowever, one caveat before I begin:\nmy data are really depressing.\nSo I want to apologize in advance,\nbecause I'm going to put you all\nin a really bad mood.\nBut I'm going to bring it up at the end,\nand I'm going to present a silver lining\nto fix this mess that we've been in\nfor a very, very long time.\n\n\n\n 2:12\n\n\nSo, let's start with the gravity\nof the situation.\nEach year, my research team\nexamines the top 100 grossing films\nin the United States.\nWhat we do is we look at every speaking\nor named character on-screen.\nNow, to count in one of my investigations,\nall a character has to do is say one word.\nThis is a very low bar.\n\n\n\n 2:35\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 2:37\n\n\nThus far, we've looked at 800 movies,\nfrom 2007 to 2015,\ncataloguing every speaking character\non-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,\nLGBT and characters with a disability.\n\n\n\n 2:50\n\n\nLet's take a look\nat really some problematic trends.\nFirst, females are still\nnoticeably absent on-screen in film.\nAcross 800 movies\nand 35,205 speaking characters,\nless than a third of all roles\ngo to girls and women.\nLess than a third!\nThere's been no change from 2007 to 2015,\nand if you compare our results\nto a small sample of films\nfrom 1946 to 1955,\nthere's been no change\nin over a half of a century.\nOver half of a century!\nBut we're half of the population.\n\n\n\n 3:26\n\n\nNow, if we look at this data\nintersectionally,\nwhich has been a focus of today,\nthe picture becomes even more problematic.\nAcross the top 100 films\nof just last year,\n48 films didn't feature one black\nor African-American speaking character,\nnot one.\n70 films were devoid of Asian\nor Asian-American speaking characters\nthat were girls or women.\nNone.\nEighty-four films didn't feature one\nfemale character that had a disability.\nAnd 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual\nor transgender female speaking characters.\nThis is not underrepresentation.\nThis is erasure,\nand I call this\nthe epidemic of invisibility.\n\n\n\n 4:11\n\n\nNow, when we move\nfrom prevalence to protagonist,\nthe story is still problematic.\nOut of a hundred films last year,\nonly 32 featured a female lead\nor colead driving the action.\nOnly three out of a hundred films\nfeatured an underrepresented\nfemale driving the story,\nand only one diverse woman\nthat was 45 years of age or older\nat the time of theatrical release.\n\n\n\n 4:37\n\n\nNow let's look at portrayal.\nIn addition to the numbers you just saw,\nfemales are far more likely\nto be sexualized in film\nthan their male counterparts.\nMatter of fact, they're about\nthree times as likely\nto be shown in sexually\nrevealing clothing,\npartially naked,\nand they're far more likely to be thin.\nNow, sometimes, in animation,\nfemales are so thin\nthat their waist size approximates\nthe circumference of their upper arm.\n\n\n\n 5:04\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:05\n\n\nWe like to say that these gals\nhave no room for a womb\nor any other internal organ.\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 5:13\n\n\nNow, all joking aside,\ntheories suggest, research confirms,\nexposure to thin ideals\nand objectifying content\ncan lead to body dissatisfaction,\ninternalization of the thin ideal\nand self-objectification\namong some female viewers.\nObviously, what we see on-screen\nand what we see in the world,\nthey do not match.\nThey do not match!\nMatter of fact,\nif we lived in the screen world,\nwe would have a population\ncrisis on our hands.\n\n\n\n 5:41\n\n\nSo, as soon as I recognized\nthese patterns,\nI wanted to find out why,\nand it turns out that there are\ntwo drivers to inequality on-screen:\ncontent creator gender\nand misperceptions of the audience.\nLet's unpack them really quick.\n\n\n\n 5:53\n\n\nIf you want to change\nany of the patterns I just talked about,\nall you have to do\nis hire female directors.\nTurns out, the female directors\nare associated with,\nin terms of short films and indie films,\nmore girls and women on-screen,\nmore stories with women in the center,\nmore stories with women\n40 years of age or older on-screen,\nwhich I think is good news for this crowd.\nMore underrepresented —\n\n\n\n 6:19\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:21\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\n\n 6:22\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:24\n\n\nSorry but not sorry.\nMore underrepresented characters\nin terms of race and ethnicity,\nand most importantly,\nmore women working behind the camera\nin key production roles.\nEasy answer to the problems\nthat we just talked about.\nOr is it?\nIt's actually not.\n800 films, 2007-2015,\n886 directors.\nOnly 4.1 percent are women.\nOnly three are African-American or black,\nand only one woman was Asian.\n\n\n\n 6:56\n\n\nSo why is it so difficult\nto have female directors\nif they're part of the solution?\nWell, to answer this question,\nwe conducted a study.\nWe interviewed dozens of industry insiders\nand asked them about directors.\nTurns out, both male\nand female executives,\nwhen they think director,\nthey think male.\nThey perceive the traits of leadership\nto be masculine in nature.\nSo when they're going to hire a director\nto command a crew, lead a ship,\nbe a visionary or be General Patton,\nall the things that we've heard —\ntheir thoughts and ideations pull male.\nThe perception of director or a leader\nis inconsistent\nwith the perception of a woman.\nThe roles are incongruous,\nwhich is consistent with a lot of research\nin the psychological arena.\n\n\n\n 7:51\n\n\nSecond factor contributing\nto inequality on-screen\nis misperceptions of the audience.\nI don't need to tell this crowd:\n50 percent of the people\nthat go to the box office and buy tickets\nare girls and women in this country.\nRight?\nBut we're not perceived to be a viable\nor financially lucrative target audience.\nFurther, there's some misperceptions\nabout whether females can open a film.\nOpen a film means that if you\nplace a female at the center,\nit doesn't have the return on investment\nthat if you place a male\nat the center of a story does.\n\n\n\n 8:24\n\n\nThis misperception is actually costly.\nRight?\nEspecially in the wake\nof franchise successes\nlike \"The Hunger Games,\"\n\"Pitch Perfect\"\nor that small little indie film,\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\nOur own economic analyses show\nthat gender of the lead character\ndoesn't play a role in economic success\nin the United States.\nBut what does?\nProduction costs alone\nor in conjunction with how widely\na film is distributed in this country.\nIt's not the gender of the lead character.\n\n\n\n 8:59\n\n\nSo at this point, we should\nall be sufficiently depressed.\nNo change in 50 years,\nfew female directors\nworking behind the camera\nand the entertainment industry\ndoes not trust us as an audience.\nWell, I told you\nthere would be a silver lining,\nand there is.\nThere are actually\nsimple and tangible solutions\nto fixing this problem\nthat involve content creators,\nexecutives and consumers\nlike the individuals in this room.\nLet's talk about a few of them.\n\n\n\n 9:30\n\n\nThe first is what I call \"just add five.\"\nDid you know if we looked\nat the top 100 films next year\nand simply added five female\nspeaking characters on-screen\nto each of those films,\nit would create a new norm.\nIf we were to do this\nfor three contiguous years,\nwe would be at gender parity\nfor the first time\nin over a half of a century.\nNow, this approach is advantageous\nfor a variety of reasons.\nOne? It doesn't take away jobs\nfor male actors.\nHeaven forbid.\n\n\n\n10:01\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\nTwo, it's actually cost-effective.\nIt doesn't cost that much.\nThree, it builds a pipeline for talent.\nAnd four, it humanizes\nthe production process.\nWhy? Because it makes sure\nthat there's women on set.\n\n\n\n10:16\n\n\nSecond solution is for A-list talent.\nA-listers, as we all know,\ncan make demands in their contracts,\nparticularly the ones that work\non the biggest Hollywood films.\nWhat if those A-listers\nsimply added an equity clause\nor an inclusion rider\ninto their contract?\nNow, what does that mean?\nWell, you probably don't know\nbut the typical feature film\nhas about 40 to 45\nspeaking characters in it.\nI would argue that only 8 to 10\nof those characters\nare actually relevant to the story.\nExcept maybe \"Avengers.\" Right?\nA few more in \"Avengers.\"\nThe remaining 30 or so roles,\nthere's no reason why those minor roles\ncan't match or reflect the demography\nof where the story is taking place.\nAn equity rider by an A-lister\nin their contract\ncan stipulate that those roles\nreflect the world\nin which we actually live.\nNow, there's no reason why a network,\na studio or a production company\ncannot adopt the same contractual language\nin their negotiation processes.\n\n\n\n11:26\n\n\nThird solution:\nthis would be for\nthe entertainment industry,\nHollywood in particular,\nto adopt the Rooney Rule\nwhen it comes to hiring practices\naround directors.\nNow, in the NFL,\nthe Rooney Rule stipulates\nthat if a team wants to hire a coach\nfrom outside the organization,\nwhat they have to do is interview\nan underrepresented candidate.\nThe exact same principle\ncan apply to Hollywood films.\nHow?\nWell, on these top films,\nexecutives and agents can make sure\nthat women and people of color\nare not only on the consideration list,\nbut they're actually\ninterviewed for the job.\nNow, one might say,\nwhy is this important?\nBecause it exposes or introduces\nexecutives to female directors\nwho otherwise fall prey\nto exclusionary hiring practices.\n\n\n\n12:21\n\n\nThe fourth solution\nis for consumers like me and you.\nIf we want to see more films\nby, for and about women,\nwe have to support them.\nIt may mean going\nto the independent theater chain\ninstead of the multiplex.\nOr it might mean scrolling down\na little further online\nto find a film by a female director.\nOr it may be writing a check\nand funding a film,\nparticularly by a female director\nfrom an underrepresented background.\nRight?\nWe need to write, call and email companies\nthat are making and distributing films,\nand we need to post\non our social media accounts\nwhen we want to see\ninclusive representation,\nwomen on-screen,\nand most importantly,\nwomen behind the camera.\nWe need to make our voices heard\nand our dollars count.\n\n\n\n13:12\n\n\nNow, we actually have the ability\nto change the world on this one.\nThe US and its content,\nfilms in particular,\nhave captured the imaginations\nof audiences worldwide.\nWorldwide.\nSo that means that the film industry\nhas unprecedented access\nto be able to distribute\nstories about equality\nall around the world.\nImagine what would happen\nif the film industry aligned its values\nwith what it shows on-screen.\nIt could foster inclusion\nand acceptance for girls and women,\npeople of color,\nthe LGBT community,\nindividuals with disabilities,\nand so many more around the world.\nThe only thing that the film industry\nhas to do is unleash its secret weapon,\nand that's storytelling.\n\n\n\n14:14\n\n\nNow, at the beginning of this talk,\nI said that films —\nthat they can actually transport us,\nbut I would like to argue\nthat films, they can transform us.\nNone of us in this room\nhave grown up or experienced\na storytelling landscape\nwith fully realized female characters,\nnone of us,\nbecause the numbers haven't changed.\nWhat would happen\nif the next generation of audiences\ngrew up with a whole\ndifferent screen reality?\nWhat would happen?\nWell I'm here to tell you today\nthat it's not only possible\nto change what we see on-screen\nbut I am impatient for it to get here.\n\n\n\n15:02\n\n\nSo let's agree to take action today\nto eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.\nAnd let's agree to take action today\nto agree that US audiences\nand global viewers\ndemand and deserve more.\nAnd let's agree today\nthat the next generation\nof viewers and audiences,\nthat they deserve to see the stories\nwe were never able to see.\n\n\n\n15:35\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n15:36\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nHello, I'm Joy, a poet of code,\non a mission to stop\nan unseen force that's rising,\na force that I called \"the coded gaze,\"\nmy term for algorithmic bias.\n\n\n\n 0:26\n\n\nAlgorithmic bias, like human bias,\nresults in unfairness.\nHowever, algorithms, like viruses,\ncan spread bias on a massive scale\nat a rapid pace.\nAlgorithmic bias can also lead\nto exclusionary experiences\nand discriminatory practices.\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n\n\n 0:47\n\n\n(Video) Joy Buolamwini: Hi, camera.\nI've got a face.\nCan you see my face?\nNo-glasses face?\nYou can see her face.\nWhat about my face?\nI've got a mask. Can you see my mask?\n\n\n\n 1:07\n\n\nJoy Buolamwini: So how did this happen?\nWhy am I sitting in front of a computer\nin a white mask,\ntrying to be detected by a cheap webcam?\nWell, when I'm not fighting the coded gaze\nas a poet of code,\nI'm a graduate student\nat the MIT Media Lab,\nand there I have the opportunity to work\non all sorts of whimsical projects,\nincluding the Aspire Mirror,\na project I did so I could project\ndigital masks onto my reflection.\nSo in the morning, if I wanted\nto feel powerful,\nI could put on a lion.\nIf I wanted to be uplifted,\nI might have a quote.\nSo I used generic\nfacial recognition software\nto build the system,\nbut found it was really hard to test it\nunless I wore a white mask.\n\n\n\n 1:55\n\n\nUnfortunately, I've run\ninto this issue before.\nWhen I was an undergraduate\nat Georgia Tech studying computer science,\nI used to work on social robots,\nand one of my tasks was to get a robot\nto play peek-a-boo,\na simple turn-taking game\nwhere partners cover their face\nand then uncover it saying, \"Peek-a-boo!\"\nThe problem is, peek-a-boo\ndoesn't really work if I can't see you,\nand my robot couldn't see me.\nBut I borrowed my roommate's face\nto get the project done,\nsubmitted the assignment,\nand figured, you know what,\nsomebody else will solve this problem.\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\nNot too long after,\nI was in Hong Kong\nfor an entrepreneurship competition.\nThe organizers decided\nto take participants\non a tour of local start-ups.\nOne of the start-ups had a social robot,\nand they decided to do a demo.\nThe demo worked on everybody\nuntil it got to me,\nand you can probably guess it.\nIt couldn't detect my face.\nI asked the developers what was going on,\nand it turned out we had used the same\ngeneric facial recognition software.\nHalfway around the world,\nI learned that algorithmic bias\ncan travel as quickly\nas it takes to download\nsome files off of the internet.\n\n\n\n 3:14\n\n\nSo what's going on?\nWhy isn't my face being detected?\nWell, we have to look\nat how we give machines sight.\nComputer vision uses\nmachine learning techniques\nto do facial recognition.\nSo how this works is, you create\na training set with examples of faces.\nThis is a face. This is a face.\nThis is not a face.\nAnd over time, you can teach a computer\nhow to recognize other faces.\nHowever, if the training sets\naren't really that diverse,\nany face that deviates too much\nfrom the established norm\nwill be harder to detect,\nwhich is what was happening to me.\n\n\n\n 3:48\n\n\nBut don't worry — there's some good news.\nTraining sets don't just\nmaterialize out of nowhere.\nWe actually can create them.\nSo there's an opportunity to create\nfull-spectrum training sets\nthat reflect a richer\nportrait of humanity.\n\n\n\n 4:03\n\n\nNow you've seen in my examples\nhow social robots\nwas how I found out about exclusion\nwith algorithmic bias.\nBut algorithmic bias can also lead\nto discriminatory practices.\nAcross the US,\npolice departments are starting to use\nfacial recognition software\nin their crime-fighting arsenal.\nGeorgetown Law published a report\nshowing that one in two adults\nin the US — that's 117 million people —\nhave their faces\nin facial recognition networks.\nPolice departments can currently look\nat these networks unregulated,\nusing algorithms that have not\nbeen audited for accuracy.\nYet we know facial recognition\nis not fail proof,\nand labeling faces consistently\nremains a challenge.\nYou might have seen this on Facebook.\nMy friends and I laugh all the time\nwhen we see other people\nmislabeled in our photos.\nBut misidentifying a suspected criminal\nis no laughing matter,\nnor is breaching civil liberties.\n\n\n\n 5:11\n\n\nMachine learning is being used\nfor facial recognition,\nbut it's also extending beyond the realm\nof computer vision.\nIn her book, \"Weapons\nof Math Destruction,\"\ndata scientist Cathy O'Neil\ntalks about the rising new WMDs —\nwidespread, mysterious\nand destructive algorithms\nthat are increasingly being used\nto make decisions\nthat impact more aspects of our lives.\nSo who gets hired or fired?\nDo you get that loan?\nDo you get insurance?\nAre you admitted into the college\nyou wanted to get into?\nDo you and I pay the same price\nfor the same product\npurchased on the same platform?\n\n\n\n 5:55\n\n\nLaw enforcement is also starting\nto use machine learning\nfor predictive policing.\nSome judges use machine-generated\nrisk scores to determine\nhow long an individual\nis going to spend in prison.\nSo we really have to think\nabout these decisions.\nAre they fair?\nAnd we've seen that algorithmic bias\ndoesn't necessarily always\nlead to fair outcomes.\n\n\n\n 6:19\n\n\nSo what can we do about it?\nWell, we can start thinking about\nhow we create more inclusive code\nand employ inclusive coding practices.\nIt really starts with people.\nSo who codes matters.\nAre we creating full-spectrum teams\nwith diverse individuals\nwho can check each other's blind spots?\nOn the technical side,\nhow we code matters.\nAre we factoring in fairness\nas we're developing systems?\nAnd finally, why we code matters.\nWe've used tools of computational creation\nto unlock immense wealth.\nWe now have the opportunity\nto unlock even greater equality\nif we make social change a priority\nand not an afterthought.\nAnd so these are the three tenets\nthat will make up the \"incoding\" movement.\nWho codes matters,\nhow we code matters\nand why we code matters.\n\n\n\n 7:14\n\n\nSo to go towards incoding,\nwe can start thinking about\nbuilding platforms that can identify bias\nby collecting people's experiences\nlike the ones I shared,\nbut also auditing existing software.\nWe can also start to create\nmore inclusive training sets.\nImagine a \"Selfies for Inclusion\" campaign\nwhere you and I can help\ndevelopers test and create\nmore inclusive training sets.\nAnd we can also start thinking\nmore conscientiously\nabout the social impact\nof the technology that we're developing.\n\n\n\n 7:48\n\n\nTo get the incoding movement started,\nI've launched the Algorithmic\nJustice League,\nwhere anyone who cares about fairness\ncan help fight the coded gaze.\nOn codedgaze.com, you can report bias,\nrequest audits, become a tester\nand join the ongoing conversation,\n#codedgaze.\n\n\n\n 8:11\n\n\nSo I invite you to join me\nin creating a world where technology\nworks for all of us,\nnot just some of us,\na world where we value inclusion\nand center social change.\n\n\n\n 8:24\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 8:25\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 8:31\n\n\nBut I have one question:\nWill you join me in the fight?\n\n\n\n 8:36\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 8:38\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nI'd like you to imagine the world anew.\nI'd like to show you some maps,\nwhich have been drawn by Ben Hennig,\nof the planet in a way\nthat most of you will never\nhave seen the planet depicted before.\n\n\n\n 0:29\n\n\nHere's an image\nthat you're very familiar with.\nI'm old enough that I was actually born\nbefore we saw this image.\nApparently some of my first words\nwere \"moona, moona,\"\nbut I think that's my mom\nhaving a particular fantasy\nabout what her baby boy could see\non the flickering\nblack and white TV screen.\nIt's only been a few centuries\nsince we've actually, most of us,\nthought of our planet as spherical.\nWhen we first saw\nthese images in the 1960s,\nthe world was changing\nat an incredible rate.\nIn my own little discipline\nof human geography,\na cartographer called Waldo Tobler\nwas drawing new maps of the planet,\nand these maps have now spread,\nand I'm going to show you one of them now.\nThis map is a map of the world,\nbut it's a map which looks to you\na little bit strange.\nIt's a map in which we stretched places,\nso that those areas which contain\nmany people are drawn larger,\nand those areas,\nlike the Sahara and the Himalayas,\nin which there are few people,\nhave been shrunk away.\nEverybody on the planet\nis given an equal amount of space.\nThe cities are shown shining bright.\nThe lines are showing you\nsubmarine cables and trade routes.\nAnd there's one particular line\nthat goes from the Chinese port of Dalian\nthrough past Singapore,\nthrough the Suez Canal,\nthrough the Mediterranean\nand round to Rotterdam.\nAnd it's showing you the route\nof what was the world's\nlargest ship just a year ago,\na ship which was taking\nso many containers of goods\nthat when they were unloaded,\nif the lorries had all gone in convoy,\nthey would have been 100 kilometers long.\nThis is how our world is now connected.\nThis is the quantity of stuff\nwe are now moving around the world,\njust on one ship, on one voyage,\nin five weeks.\n\n\n\n 2:37\n\n\nWe've lived in cities\nfor a very long time,\nbut most of us didn't live in cities.\nThis is Çatalhöyük,\none of the world's first cities.\nAt its peak 9,000 years ago,\npeople had to walk over the roofs\nof others' houses to get to their home.\nIf you look carefully\nat the map of the city,\nyou'll see it has no streets,\nbecause streets are something we invented.\nThe world changes.\nIt changes by trial and error.\nWe work out slowly and gradually\nhow to live in better ways.\nAnd the world has changed\nincredibly quickly most recently.\nIt's only within the last six,\nseven, or eight generations\nthat we have actually realized\nthat we are a species.\nIt's only within the last few decades\nthat a map like this could be drawn.\nAgain, the underlying map\nis the map of world population,\nbut over it, you're seeing arrows\nshowing how we spread out of Africa\nwith dates showing you\nwhere we think we arrived\nat particular times.\nI have to redraw this map\nevery few months,\nbecause somebody makes a discovery\nthat a particular date was wrong.\nWe are learning about ourselves\nat an incredible speed.\nAnd we're changing.\nA lot of change is gradual.\nIt's accretion.\nWe don't notice the change\nbecause we only have short lives,\n70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.\nThis graph is showing you\nthe annual rate of population\ngrowth in the world.\nIt was very low until around about 1850,\nand then the rate of population growth\nbegan to rise\nso that around the time I was born,\nwhen we first saw those images\nfrom the moon of our planet,\nour global population\nwas growing at two percent a year.\nIf it had carried on growing\nat two percent a year\nfor just another couple of centuries,\nthe entire planet would be covered\nwith a seething mass of human bodies\nall touching each other.\nAnd people were scared.\nThey were scared of population growth\nand what they called\n\"the population bomb\" in 1968.\nBut then, if you look\nat the end of the graph,\nthe growth began to slow.\nThe decade —\nthe '70s, the '80s,\nthe '90s, the noughties,\nand in this decade, even faster —\nour population growth is slowing.\nOur planet is stabilizing.\nWe are heading towards nine,\n10, or 11 billion people\nby the end of the century.\nWithin that change, you can see tumult.\nYou can see the Second World War.\nYou can see the pandemic\nin 1918 from influenza.\nYou can see the great Chinese famine.\nThese are the events\nwe tend to concentrate on.\nWe tend to concentrate\non the terrible events in the news.\nWe don't tend to concentrate\non the gradual change\nand the good news stories.\n\n\n\n 6:08\n\n\nWe worry about people.\nWe worry about how many people there are.\nWe worry about how you can\nget away from people.\nBut this is the map of the world\nchanged again to make area large,\nthe further away\npeople are from each area.\nSo if you want to know\nwhere to go to get away from everybody,\nhere's the best places to go.\nAnd every year, these areas get bigger,\nbecause every year,\nwe are coming off the land globally.\nWe are moving into the cities.\nWe are packing in more densely.\nThere are wolves again in Europe,\nand the wolves are moving west\nacross the continent.\nOur world is changing.\n\n\n\n 6:51\n\n\nYou have worries.\nThis is a map showing\nwhere the water falls on our planet.\nWe now know that.\nAnd you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,\nwhere three continents meet,\nAfrica, Asia, and Europe,\nand you can see there are\na large number of people living there\nin areas with very little water.\nAnd you can see areas in which\nthere is a great deal of rainfall as well.\nAnd we can get a bit more sophisticated.\nInstead of making\nthe map be shaped by people,\nwe can shape the map by water,\nand then we can change it every month\nto show the amount of water\nfalling on every small part of the globe.\nAnd you see the monsoons\nmoving around the planet,\nand the planet almost appears\nto have a heartbeat.\nAnd all of this only became possible\nwithin my lifetime\nto see this is where we are living.\nWe have enough water.\n\n\n\n 7:54\n\n\nThis is a map of where\nwe grow our food in the world.\nThis is the areas that we will rely on\nmost for rice and maize and corn.\nPeople worry that there won't\nbe enough food, but we know,\nif we just ate less meat\nand fed less of the crops to animals,\nthere is enough food for everybody\nas long as we think of ourselves\nas one group of people.\n\n\n\n 8:23\n\n\nAnd we also know\nabout what we do\nso terribly badly nowadays.\nYou will have seen this map\nof the world before.\nThis is the map\nproduced by taking satellite images,\nif you remember those satellites\naround the planet\nin the very first slide I showed,\nand producing an image\nof what the Earth looks like at night.\nWhen you normally see that map,\non a normal map, the kind of map\nthat most of you will be used to,\nyou think you are seeing\na map of where people live.\nWhere the lights are shining up\nis where people live.\nBut here, on this image of the world,\nremember we've stretched the map again.\nEverywhere has the same density\nof people on this map.\nIf an area doesn't have people,\nwe've shrunk it away\nto make it disappear.\nSo we're showing everybody\nwith equal prominence.\nNow, the lights no longer show you\nwhere people are,\nbecause people are everywhere.\nNow the lights on the map,\nthe lights in London,\nthe lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,\nthe lights on the Eastern Seaboard\nof the United States,\nthe lights show you where people live\nwho are so profligate with energy\nthat they can afford\nto spend money\npowering lights to shine up into the sky,\nso satellites can draw an image like this.\nAnd the areas that are dark on the map\nare either areas where people\ndo not have access to that much energy,\nor areas where people do,\nbut they have learned to stop\nshining the light up into the sky.\nAnd if I could show you this map\nanimated over time,\nyou would see that Tokyo\nhas actually become darker,\nbecause ever since the tsunami in Japan,\nJapan has had to rely\non a quarter less electricity\nbecause it turned\nthe nuclear power stations off.\nAnd the world didn't end.\nYou just shone less light\nup into the sky.\n\n\n\n10:44\n\n\nThere are a huge number\nof good news stories in the world.\nInfant mortality is falling\nand has been falling\nat an incredible rate.\nA few years ago,\nthe number of babies dying\nin their first year of life in the world\nfell by five percent in just one year.\nMore children are going to school\nand learning to read and write\nand getting connected to the Internet\nand going on to go to university\nthan ever before at an incredible rate,\nand the highest number of young people\ngoing to university in the world\nare women, not men.\nI can give you good news story\nafter good news story\nabout what is getting\nbetter in the planet,\nbut we tend to concentrate\non the bad news that is immediate.\nRebecca Solnit, I think,\nput it brilliantly,\nwhen she explained: \"The accretion\nof incremental, imperceptible changes\nwhich can constitute progress\nand which render our era\ndramatically different from the past\" —\nthe past was much more stable —\n\"a contrast obscured by the undramatic\nnature of gradual transformation,\npunctuated by occasional tumult.\"\nOccasionally, terrible things happen.\nYou are shown those terrible things\non the news every night of the week.\nYou are not told about\nthe population slowing down.\nYou are not told about the world\nbecoming more connected.\nYou are not told about the incredible\nimprovements in understanding.\nYou are not told about\nhow we are learning to begin\nto waste less and consume less.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\nThis is my last map.\nOn this map, we have taken the seas\nand the oceans out.\nNow you are just looking\nat about 7.4 billion people\nwith the map drawn\nin proportion to those people.\nYou're looking at over a billion in China,\nand you can see the largest\ncity in the world in China,\nbut you do not know its name.\nYou can see that India\nis in the center of this world.\nYou can see that Europe is on the edge.\nAnd we in Exeter today\nare on the far edge of the planet.\nWe are on a tiny scrap of rock\noff Europe\nwhich contains less than one percent\nof the world's adults,\nand less than half a percent\nof the world's children.\nWe are living in a stabilizing world,\nan urbanizing world,\nan aging world,\na connecting world.\nThere are many, many things\nto be frightened about,\nbut there is no need for us\nto fear each other as much as we do,\nand we need to see\nthat we are now living in a new world.\n\n\n\n13:57\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n13:59\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nA hundred years ago this month,\na 36-year-old Albert Einstein\nstood up in front of the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences in Berlin\nto present a radical new theory\nof space, time and gravity:\nthe general theory of relativity.\n\n\n\n 0:26\n\n\nGeneral relativity is unquestionably\nEinstein's masterpiece,\na theory which reveals the workings\nof the universe at the grandest scales,\ncapturing in one beautiful line of algebra\neverything from why apples fall from trees\nto the beginning of time and space.\n\n\n\n 0:40\n\n\n1915 must have been an exciting year\nto be a physicist.\nTwo new ideas were turning\nthe subject on its head.\nOne was Einstein's theory of relativity,\nthe other was arguably\neven more revolutionary:\nquantum mechanics,\na mind-meltingly strange\nyet stunningly successful new way\nof understanding the microworld,\nthe world of atoms and particles.\n\n\n\n 1:02\n\n\nOver the last century,\nthese two ideas have utterly transformed\nour understanding of the universe.\nIt's thanks to relativity\nand quantum mechanics\nthat we've learned\nwhat the universe is made from,\nhow it began\nand how it continues to evolve.\nA hundred years on, we now find ourselves\nat another turning point in physics,\nbut what's at stake now\nis rather different.\nThe next few years may tell us\nwhether we'll be able\nto continue to increase\nour understanding of nature,\nor whether maybe for the first time\nin the history of science,\nwe could be facing questions\nthat we cannot answer,\nnot because we don't have\nthe brains or technology,\nbut because the laws of physics\nthemselves forbid it.\n\n\n\n 1:43\n\n\nThis is the essential problem:\nthe universe is far, far too interesting.\nRelativity and quantum mechanics\nappear to suggest\nthat the universe\nshould be a boring place.\nIt should be dark, lethal and lifeless.\nBut when we look around us, we see we live\nin a universe full of interesting stuff,\nfull of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.\nThe question is, ultimately,\nwhy does all this interesting stuff exist?\nWhy is there something\nrather than nothing?\nThis contradiction is the most pressing\nproblem in fundamental physics,\nand in the next few years, we may find out\nwhether we'll ever be able to solve it.\n\n\n\n 2:22\n\n\nAt the heart of this problem\nare two numbers,\ntwo extremely dangerous numbers.\nThese are properties of the universe\nthat we can measure,\nand they're extremely dangerous\nbecause if they were different,\neven by a tiny bit,\nthen the universe as we know it\nwould not exist.\nThe first of these numbers is associated\nwith the discovery that was made\na few kilometers from this hall,\nat CERN, home of this machine,\nthe largest scientific device\never built by the human race,\nthe Large Hadron Collider.\nThe LHC whizzes subatomic particles\naround a 27-kilometer ring,\ngetting them closer and closer\nto the speed of light\nbefore smashing them into each other\ninside gigantic particle detectors.\nOn July 4, 2012, physicists\nat CERN announced to the world\nthat they'd spotted\na new fundamental particle\nbeing created at the violent collisions\nat the LHC: the Higgs boson.\n\n\n\n 3:12\n\n\nNow, if you followed the news at the time,\nyou'll have seen a lot of physicists\ngetting very excited indeed,\nand you'd be forgiven for thinking\nwe get that way every time\nwe discover a new particle.\nWell, that is kind of true,\nbut the Higgs boson\nis particularly special.\nWe all got so excited\nbecause finding the Higgs\nproves the existence\nof a cosmic energy field.\nNow, you may have trouble\nimagining an energy field,\nbut we've all experienced one.\nIf you've ever held a magnet\nclose to a piece of metal\nand felt a force pulling across that gap,\nthen you've felt the effect of a field.\nAnd the Higgs field\nis a little bit like a magnetic field,\nexcept it has a constant value everywhere.\nIt's all around us right now.\nWe can't see it or touch it,\nbut if it wasn't there,\nwe would not exist.\nThe Higgs field gives mass\nto the fundamental particles\nthat we're made from.\nIf it wasn't there, those particles\nwould have no mass,\nand no atoms could form\nand there would be no us.\n\n\n\n 4:05\n\n\nBut there is something deeply mysterious\nabout the Higgs field.\nRelativity and quantum mechanics tell us\nthat it has two natural settings,\na bit like a light switch.\nIt should either be off,\nso that it has a zero value\neverywhere in space,\nor it should be on so it has\nan absolutely enormous value.\nIn both of these scenarios,\natoms could not exist,\nand therefore all the other\ninteresting stuff\nthat we see around us\nin the universe would not exist.\nIn reality, the Higgs field\nis just slightly on,\nnot zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker\nthan its fully on value,\na bit like a light switch that's got stuck\njust before the off position.\nAnd this value is crucial.\nIf it were a tiny bit different,\nthen there would be\nno physical structure in the universe.\n\n\n\n 4:52\n\n\nSo this is the first\nof our dangerous numbers,\nthe strength of the Higgs field.\nTheorists have spent decades\ntrying to understand\nwhy it has this very peculiarly\nfine-tuned number,\nand they've come up\nwith a number of possible explanations.\nThey have sexy-sounding names\nlike \"supersymmetry\"\nor \"large extra dimensions.\"\nI'm not going to go\ninto the details of these ideas now,\nbut the key point is this:\nif any of them explained this weirdly\nfine-tuned value of the Higgs field,\nthen we should see new particles\nbeing created at the LHC\nalong with the Higgs boson.\nSo far, though, we've not seen\nany sign of them.\n\n\n\n 5:28\n\n\nBut there's actually an even worse example\nof this kind of fine-tuning\nof a dangerous number,\nand this time it comes\nfrom the other end of the scale,\nfrom studying the universe\nat vast distances.\nOne of the most important consequences\nof Einstein's general theory of relativity\nwas the discovery that the universe began\nas a rapid expansion of space and time\n13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.\nNow, according to early versions\nof the Big Bang theory,\nthe universe has been expanding ever since\nwith gravity gradually putting\nthe brakes on that expansion.\nBut in 1998, astronomers made\nthe stunning discovery\nthat the expansion of the universe\nis actually speeding up.\nThe universe is getting\nbigger and bigger faster and faster\ndriven by a mysterious repulsive force\ncalled dark energy.\n\n\n\n 6:14\n\n\nNow, whenever you hear\nthe word \"dark\" in physics,\nyou should get very suspicious\nbecause it probably means\nwe don't know what we're talking about.\n\n\n\n 6:21\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:22\n\n\nWe don't know what dark energy is,\nbut the best idea is that it's the energy\nof empty space itself,\nthe energy of the vacuum.\nNow, if you use good old\nquantum mechanics to work out\nhow strong dark energy should be,\nyou get an absolutely astonishing result.\nYou find that dark energy\nshould be 10 to the power\nof 120 times stronger\nthan the value we observe from astronomy.\nThat's one with 120 zeroes after it.\nThis is a number so mind-bogglingly huge\nthat it's impossible\nto get your head around.\nWe often use the word \"astronomical\"\nwhen we're talking about big numbers.\nWell, even that one won't do here.\nThis number is bigger\nthan any number in astronomy.\nIt's a thousand trillion\ntrillion trillion times bigger\nthan the number of atoms\nin the entire universe.\n\n\n\n 7:11\n\n\nSo that's a pretty bad prediction.\nIn fact, it's been called\nthe worst prediction in physics,\nand this is more than just\na theoretical curiosity.\nIf dark energy were\nanywhere near this strong,\nthen the universe\nwould have been torn apart,\nstars and galaxies could not form,\nand we would not be here.\nSo this is the second\nof those dangerous numbers,\nthe strength of dark energy,\nand explaining it requires an even more\nfantastic level of fine-tuning\nthan we saw for the Higgs field.\nBut unlike the Higgs field,\nthis number has no known explanation.\n\n\n\n 7:44\n\n\nThe hope was that a complete combination\nof Einstein's general\ntheory of relativity,\nwhich is the theory\nof the universe at grand scales,\nwith quantum mechanics, the theory\nof the universe at small scales,\nmight provide a solution.\nEinstein himself\nspent most of his later years\non a futile search\nfor a unified theory of physics,\nand physicists have kept at it ever since.\n\n\n\n 8:05\n\n\nOne of the most promising candidates\nfor a unified theory is string theory,\nand the essential idea is,\nif you could zoom in on the fundamental\nparticles that make up our world,\nyou'd see actually\nthat they're not particles at all,\nbut tiny vibrating strings of energy,\nwith each frequency of vibration\ncorresponding to a different particle,\na bit like musical notes\non a guitar string.\n\n\n\n 8:27\n\n\nSo it's a rather elegant, almost poetic\nway of looking at the world,\nbut it has one catastrophic problem.\nIt turns out that string theory\nisn't one theory at all,\nbut a whole collection of theories.\nIt's been estimated, in fact,\nthat there are 10 to the 500\ndifferent versions of string theory.\nEach one would describe\na different universe\nwith different laws of physics.\nNow, critics say this makes\nstring theory unscientific.\nYou can't disprove the theory.\nBut others actually\nturned this on its head\nand said, well,\nmaybe this apparent failure\nis string theory's greatest triumph.\nWhat if all of these 10 to the 500\ndifferent possible universes\nactually exist out there somewhere\nin some grand multiverse?\nSuddenly we can understand\nthe weirdly fine-tuned values\nof these two dangerous numbers.\nIn most of the multiverse,\ndark energy is so strong\nthat the universe gets torn apart,\nor the Higgs field is so weak\nthat no atoms can form.\nWe live in one of the places\nin the multiverse\nwhere the two numbers are just right.\nWe live in a Goldilocks universe.\n\n\n\n 9:30\n\n\nNow, this idea is extremely controversial,\nand it's easy to see why.\nIf we follow this line of thinking,\nthen we will never be able\nto answer the question,\n\"Why is there something\nrather than nothing?\"\nIn most of the multiverse,\nthere is nothing,\nand we live in one of the few places\nwhere the laws of physics\nallow there to be something.\nEven worse, we can't test\nthe idea of the multiverse.\nWe can't access these other universes,\nso there's no way of knowing\nwhether they're there or not.\n\n\n\n10:00\n\n\nSo we're in an extremely\nfrustrating position.\nThat doesn't mean\nthe multiverse doesn't exist.\nThere are other planets,\nother stars, other galaxies,\nso why not other universes?\nThe problem is, it's unlikely\nwe'll ever know for sure.\nNow, the idea of the multiverse\nhas been around for a while,\nbut in the last few years,\nwe've started to get the first solid hints\nthat this line of reasoning\nmay get born out.\nDespite high hopes\nfor the first run of the LHC,\nwhat we were looking for there —\nwe were looking\nfor new theories of physics:\nsupersymmetry or large extra dimensions\nthat could explain this weirdly\nfine-tuned value of the Higgs field.\nBut despite high hopes, the LHC\nrevealed a barren subatomic wilderness\npopulated only by a lonely Higgs boson.\nMy experiment published paper after paper\nwhere we glumly had to conclude\nthat we saw no signs of new physics.\n\n\n\n10:55\n\n\nThe stakes now could not be higher.\nThis summer, the LHC began\nits second phase of operation\nwith an energy almost double\nwhat we achieved in the first run.\nWhat particle physicists\nare all desperately hoping for\nare signs of new particles,\nmicro black holes,\nor maybe something totally unexpected\nemerging from the violent collisions\nat the Large Hadron Collider.\nIf so, then we can continue\nthis long journey\nthat began 100 years ago\nwith Albert Einstein\ntowards an ever deeper understanding\nof the laws of nature.\n\n\n\n11:24\n\n\nBut if, in two or three years' time,\nwhen the LHC switches off again\nfor a second long shutdown,\nwe've found nothing but the Higgs boson,\nthen we may be entering\na new era in physics:\nan era where there are weird features\nof the universe that we cannot explain;\nan era where we have hints\nthat we live in a multiverse\nthat lies frustratingly\nforever beyond our reach;\nan era where we will never be able\nto answer the question,\n\"Why is there something\nrather than nothing?\"\n\n\n\n11:54\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:55\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n12:02\n\n\nBruno Giussani: Harry,\neven if you just said\nthe science may not have some answers,\nI would like to ask you a couple\nof questions, and the first is:\nbuilding something like the LHC\nis a generational project.\nI just mentioned, introducing you,\nthat we live in a short-term world.\nHow do you think so long term,\nprojecting yourself out a generation\nwhen building something like this?\n\n\n\n12:23\n\n\nHarry Cliff: I was very lucky\nthat I joined the experiment\nI work on at the LHC in 2008,\njust as we were switching on,\nand there are people in my research group\nwho have been working on it\nfor three decades,\ntheir entire careers on one machine.\nSo I think the first conversations\nabout the LHC were in 1976,\nand you start planning the machine\nwithout the technology\nthat you know you're going to need\nto be able to build it.\nSo the computing power\ndid not exist in the early '90s\nwhen design work began in earnest.\nOne of the big detectors\nwhich record these collisions,\nthey didn't think there was technology\nthat could withstand the radiation\nthat would be created in the LHC,\nso there was basically a lump of lead\nin the middle of this object\nwith some detectors around the outside,\nbut subsequently\nwe have developed technology.\nSo you have to rely on people's ingenuity,\nthat they will solve the problems,\nbut it may be a decade\nor more down the line.\n\n\n\n13:06\n\n\nBG: China just announced\ntwo or three weeks ago\nthat they intend to build\na supercollider twice the size of the LHC.\nI was wondering how you\nand your colleagues welcome the news.\n\n\n\n13:16\n\n\nHC: Size isn't everything, Bruno.\nBG: I'm sure. I'm sure.\n\n\n\n13:19\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n13:21\n\n\nIt sounds funny for a particle\nphysicist to say that.\nBut I mean, seriously, it's great news.\nSo building a machine like the LHC\nrequires countries from all over the world\nto pool their resources.\nNo one nation can afford\nto build a machine this large,\napart from maybe China,\nbecause they can mobilize\nhuge amounts of resources,\nmanpower and money\nto build machines like this.\nSo it's only a good thing.\nWhat they're really planning to do\nis to build a machine\nthat will study the Higgs boson in detail\nand could give us some clues\nas to whether these new ideas,\nlike supersymmetry, are really out there,\nso it's great news for physics, I think.\n\n\n\n13:50\n\n\nBG: Harry, thank you.\nHC: Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n13:52\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nGrowing up in Kenya,\nI knew I always wanted\nto study biochemistry.\nSee, I had seen the impact of the high\nprevalence of diseases like malaria,\nand I wanted to make medicines\nthat would cure the sick.\nSo I worked really hard,\ngot a scholarship to the United States,\nwhere I became a cancer researcher,\nand I loved it.\nFor someone who wants to cure diseases,\nthere is no higher calling.\n\n\n\n 0:38\n\n\nTen years later, I returned\nto Kenya to do just that.\nA freshly minted PhD,\nready to take on this horrific illness,\nwhich in Kenya was almost\ncertainly a death sentence.\nBut instead of landing a job\nin a pharmaceutical company\nor a hospital,\nI found myself drawn\nto a different kind of lab,\nworking with a different\nkind of patient —\na patient whose illness was so serious\nit impacted every single\nperson in my country;\na patient who needed to get healthy fast.\nThat patient was my government.\n\n\n\n 1:13\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:15\n\n\nSee, many of us will agree that lots\nof governments are unhealthy today.\n\n\n\n 1:19\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 1:21\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 1:27\n\n\nAnd Kenya was no exception.\nWhen I returned to Kenya in 2014,\nthere was 17 percent youth unemployment.\nAnd Nairobi, the major business hub,\nwas rated 177th on the quality\nof living index.\nIt was bad.\n\n\n\n 1:45\n\n\nNow, an economy is only as healthy\nas the entities that make it up.\nSo when government —\none of its most vital entities —\nis weak or unhealthy,\neveryone and everything suffers.\nSometimes you might\nput a Band-Aid in place\nto try and temporarily stop the pain.\nMaybe some of you here have participated\nin a Band-Aid operation\nto an African country —\nsetting up alternative schools,\nbuilding hospitals, digging wells —\nbecause governments there\neither weren't or couldn't provide\nthe services to their citizens.\n\n\n\n 2:18\n\n\nWe all know this is a temporary solution.\nThere are just some things\nBand-Aids can't fix,\nlike providing an environment\nwhere businesses feel secure\nthat they'll have an equal opportunity\nto be able to run and start\ntheir businesses successfully.\nOr there are systems in place\nthat would protect the private\nproperty that they create.\nI would argue,\nonly government is capable of creating\nthese necessary conditions\nfor economies to thrive.\n\n\n\n 2:47\n\n\nEconomies thrive when business are able\nto quickly and easily set up shop.\nBusiness owners create new sources\nof income for themselves,\nnew jobs get added into the economy\nand then more taxes are paid\nto fund public projects.\nNew business is good for everyone.\nAnd it's such an important measure\nof economic growth,\nthe World Bank has a ranking called\nthe \"Ease of Doing Business Ranking,\"\nwhich measures how easy\nor difficult it is to start a business\nin any given country.\nAnd as you can imagine,\nstarting or running a business\nin a country with an ailing government —\nalmost impossible.\n\n\n\n 3:25\n\n\nThe President of Kenya knew this,\nwhich is why in 2014,\nhe came to our lab and asked\nus to partner with him\nto be able to help Kenya\nto jump-start business growth.\nHe set an ambitious goal:\nhe wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50\nin this World Bank ranking.\nIn 2014 when he came,\nKenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.\nWe had our work cut out for us.\n\n\n\n 3:54\n\n\nFortunately, he came to the right place.\nWe're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.\nWe're a group of computer scientists,\nmathematicians, engineers\nand a cancer researcher,\nwho understood that in order\nto cure the sickness\nof a system as big as government,\nwe needed to examine the whole body,\nand then we needed to drill down\nall the way from the organs,\ninto the tissues,\nall the way to single cells,\nso that we could properly\nmake a diagnosis.\n\n\n\n 4:21\n\n\nSo with our marching orders\nfrom the President himself,\nwe embarked on the purest\nof the scientific method:\ncollecting data —\nall the data we could get our hands on —\nmaking hypotheses,\ncreating solutions,\none after the other.\n\n\n\n 4:35\n\n\nSo we met with hundreds of individuals\nwho worked at government agencies,\nfrom the tax agency, the lands\noffice, utilities company,\nthe agency that's responsible\nfor registering companies,\nand with each of them, we observed\nthem as they served customers,\nwe documented their processes —\nmost of them were manual.\nWe also just went back and looked at\na lot of their previous paperwork\nto try and really understand;\nto try and diagnose what bodily\nmalfunctions had occurred\nthat lead to that 136th spot\non the World Bank list.\n\n\n\n 5:09\n\n\nWhat did we find?\nWell, in Kenya it was taking 72 days\nfor a business owner\nto register their property,\ncompared to just one day in New Zealand,\nwhich was ranked second\non the World Bank list.\nIt took 158 days to get\na new electric connection.\nIn Korea it took 18 days.\nIf you wanted to get a construction permit\nso you could put up a building,\nin Kenya, it was going\nto take you 125 days.\nIn Singapore, which is ranked first,\nthat would only take you 26 days.\nGod forbid you had to go to court\nto get help in being able to settle\na dispute to enforce a contract,\nbecause that process alone\nwould take you 465 days.\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough,\nyou would lose 40 percent\nof your claim in just fees —\nlegal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.\n\n\n\n 6:08\n\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking:\nfor there to exist such inefficiencies\nin an African country,\nthere must be corruption.\nThe very cells that run the show\nmust be corrupt to the bone.\nI thought so, too, actually.\nWhen we started out,\nI thought I was going to find\nso much corruption,\nI was literally going to either die\nor get killed in the process.\n\n\n\n 6:32\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 6:35\n\n\nBut when we dug deeper,\nwe didn't find corruption\nin the classic sense:\nslimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,\nwaiting to grease the palms\nof their friends.\nWhat we found was an overwhelming\nsense of helplessness.\nOur government was sick,\nbecause government\nemployees felt helpless.\nThey felt that they were not\nempowered to drive change.\nAnd when people feel stuck and helpless,\nthey stop seeing their role\nin a bigger system.\nThey start to think the work they do\ndoesn't matter in driving change.\nAnd when that happens,\nthings slow down,\nfall through the cracks\nand inefficiencies flourish.\n\n\n\n 7:22\n\n\nNow imagine with me,\nif you had a process\nyou had to go through —\nhad no other alternative —\nand this process was inefficient, complex\nand very, very slow.\nWhat would you do?\nI think you might start by trying\nto find somebody to outsource it to,\nso that they can just\ntake care of that for you.\nIf that doesn't work,\nmaybe you'd consider paying somebody\nto just \"unofficially\" take care\nof it on your behalf —\nespecially if you thought\nnobody was going to catch you.\nNot out of malice or greed,\njust trying to make sure that you get\nsomething to work for you\nso you can move on.\nUnfortunately, that\nis the beginning of corruption.\nAnd if left to thrive and grow,\nit seeps into the whole system,\nand before you know it,\nthe whole body is sick.\n\n\n\n 8:15\n\n\nKnowing this,\nwe had to start by making sure\nthat every single stakeholder\nwe worked with had a shared vision\nfor what we wanted to do.\nSo we met with everyone,\nfrom the clerk whose sole job\nis to remove staples\nfrom application packets,\nto the legal drafters\nat the attorney general's office,\nto the clerks who are responsible\nfor serving business owners\nwhen they came to access\ngovernment services.\nAnd with them,\nwe made sure that they understood\nhow their day-to-day actions\nwere impacting our ability as a country\nto create new jobs\nand to attract investments.\nNo one's role was too small;\neveryone's role was vital.\n\n\n\n 8:59\n\n\nNow, guess what we started to see?\nA coalition of government employees\nwho are excited and ready to drive change,\nbegan to grow and form.\nAnd together we started\nto implement changes\nthat impacted the service\ndelivery of our country.\n\n\n\n 9:15\n\n\nThe result?\nIn just two years,\nKenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.\n\n\n\n 9:24\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:31\n\n\nAnd in recognition of the significant\nreforms we've been able to implement\nin such a short time,\nKenya was recognized\nto be among the top three\nglobal reformers in the world\ntwo years in a row.\n\n\n\n 9:45\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n\n\n 9:52\n\n\nAre we fully healthy?\nNo.\nWe have some serious work still to do.\nI like to think about these two years\nlike a weight-loss program.\n\n\n\n10:03\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n10:05\n\n\nIt's that time after months\nof hard, grueling work at the gym,\nand then you get your first\ntime to weigh yourself,\nand you've lost 20 pounds.\nYou're feeling unstoppable.\n\n\n\n10:17\n\n\nNow, some of you may think\nthis doesn't apply to you.\nYou're not from Kenya.\nYou don't intend to be an entrepreneur.\nBut think with me for just a moment.\nWhen is the last time\nyou accessed a government service?\nMaybe applied for your driver's license,\ntried to do your taxes on your own.\nIt's easy in this political\nand global economy\nto want to give up when we think\nabout transforming government.\nWe can easily resign to the fact\nor to the thinking\nthat government is too inefficient,\ntoo corrupt,\nunfixable.\nWe might even rarely get\nsome key government responsibilities\nto other sectors,\nto Band-Aid solutions,\nor to just give up and feel helpless.\nBut just because a system is sick\ndoesn't mean it's dying.\nWe cannot afford to give up\nwhen it comes to the challenges\nof fixing our governments.\n\n\n\n11:18\n\n\nIn the end,\nwhat really makes a government healthy\nis when healthy cells —\nthat's you and I —\nget to the ground,\nroll up our sleeves,\nrefuse to be helpless\nand believe that sometimes,\nall it takes is for us\nto create some space\nfor healthy cells to grow and thrive.\n\n\n\n11:41\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n11:42\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:12\n\n\nThis story starts with these two —\nmy kids.\nWe were hiking in the Oakland woods\nwhen my daughter noticed\na plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.\nShe looked at me and said,\n\"Daddy?\nThat doesn't go there.\"\n\n\n\n 0:28\n\n\nWhen she said that,\nit reminded me of summer camp.\nOn the morning of visiting day,\nright before they'd let our anxious\nparents come barreling through the gates,\nour camp director would say,\n\"Quick! Everyone pick up\nfive pieces of litter.\"\nYou get a couple hundred kids\neach picking up five pieces,\nand pretty soon, you've got\na much cleaner camp.\nSo I thought,\nwhy not apply that crowdsourced\ncleanup model to the entire planet?\nAnd that was the inspiration\nfor Litterati.\n\n\n\n 0:54\n\n\nThe vision is to create\na litter-free world.\nLet me show you how it started.\nI took a picture of a cigarette\nusing Instagram.\nThen I took another photo ...\nand another photo ...\nand another photo.\nAnd I noticed two things:\none, litter became artistic\nand approachable;\nand two,\nat the end of a few days,\nI had 50 photos on my phone\nand I had picked up each piece,\nand I realized that I was keeping a record\nof the positive impact\nI was having on the planet.\nThat's 50 less things that you might see,\nor you might step on,\nor some bird might eat.\n\n\n\n 1:29\n\n\nSo I started telling people\nwhat I was doing,\nand they started participating.\nOne day,\nthis photo showed up from China.\nAnd that's when I realized\nthat Litterati was more\nthan just pretty pictures;\nwe were becoming a community\nthat was collecting data.\nEach photo tells a story.\nIt tells us who picked up what,\na geotag tells us where\nand a time stamp tells us when.\nSo I built a Google map,\nand started plotting the points\nwhere pieces were being picked up.\nAnd through that process,\nthe community grew\nand the data grew.\nMy two kids go to school\nright in that bullseye.\n\n\n\n 2:16\n\n\nLitter:\nit's blending into\nthe background of our lives.\nBut what if we brought it\nto the forefront?\nWhat if we understood exactly\nwhat was on our streets,\nour sidewalks\nand our school yards?\nHow might we use that data\nto make a difference?\n\n\n\n 2:32\n\n\nWell, let me show you.\nThe first is with cities.\nSan Francisco wanted to understand\nwhat percentage of litter was cigarettes.\nWhy?\nTo create a tax.\nSo they put a couple of people\nin the streets\nwith pencils and clipboards,\nwho walked around collecting information\nwhich led to a 20-cent tax\non all cigarette sales.\nAnd then they got sued\nby big tobacco,\nwho claimed that collecting information\nwith pencils and clipboards\nis neither precise nor provable.\nThe city called me and asked\nif our technology could help.\nI'm not sure they realized\nthat our technology\nwas my Instagram account —\n\n\n\n 3:09\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:10\n\n\nBut I said, \"Yes, we can.\"\n\n\n\n 3:12\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:13\n\n\n\"And we can tell you\nif that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.\nPlus, every photograph\nis geotagged and time-stamped,\nproviding you with proof.\"\nFour days and 5,000 pieces later,\nour data was used in court\nto not only defend but double the tax,\ngenerating an annual recurring revenue\nof four million dollars\nfor San Francisco to clean itself up.\n\n\n\n 3:39\n\n\nNow, during that process\nI learned two things:\none, Instagram is not the right tool —\n\n\n\n 3:43\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\n 3:44\n\n\nso we built an app.\n\n\n\n 3:46\n\n\nAnd two, if you think about it,\nevery city in the world\nhas a unique litter fingerprint,\nand that fingerprint provides\nboth the source of the problem\nand the path to the solution.\nIf you could generate a revenue stream\njust by understanding\nthe percentage of cigarettes,\nwell, what about coffee cups\nor soda cans\nor plastic bottles?\nIf you could fingerprint San Francisco,\nwell, how about Oakland\nor Amsterdam\nor somewhere much closer to home?\nAnd what about brands?\nHow might they use this data\nto align their environmental\nand economic interests?\n\n\n\n 4:26\n\n\nThere's a block in downtown Oakland\nthat's covered in blight.\nThe Litterati community got together\nand picked up 1,500 pieces.\nAnd here's what we learned:\nmost of that litter came\nfrom a very well-known taco brand.\nMost of that brand's litter\nwere their own hot sauce packets,\nand most of those hot sauce packets\nhadn't even been opened.\nThe problem and the path\nto the solution —\nwell, maybe that brand only\ngives out hot sauce upon request\nor installs bulk dispensers\nor comes up with more\nsustainable packaging.\nHow does a brand take\nan environmental hazard,\nturn it into an economic engine\nand become an industry hero?\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\nIf you really want to create change,\nthere's no better place to start\nthan with our kids.\nA group of fifth graders picked up\n1,247 pieces of litter\njust on their school yard.\nAnd they learned that the most\ncommon type of litter\nwere the plastic straw wrappers\nfrom their own cafeteria.\nSo these kids went\nto their principal and asked,\n\"Why are we still buying straws?\"\nAnd they stopped.\nAnd they learned that individually\nthey could each make a difference,\nbut together they created an impact.\n\n\n\n 5:40\n\n\nIt doesn't matter\nif you're a student or a scientist,\nwhether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,\nthis is a community for everyone.\nIt started because of two little kids\nin the Northern California woods,\nand today it's spread across the world.\nAnd you know how we're getting there?\nOne piece at a time.\n\n\n\n 6:03\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n 6:04\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"

      "\n\n 0:11\n\n\nNow when we think of our senses,\nwe don't usually think of the reasons\nwhy they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.\nWe don't really think of the evolutionary need\nto be protected by our senses,\nbut that's probably why our senses really evolved —\nto keep us safe, to allow us to live.\nReally when we think of our senses,\nor when we think of the loss of the sense,\nwe really think about something more like this:\nthe ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,\nto smell something fragrant,\nto see something beautiful.\nThis is what we want out of our senses.\nWe want beauty; we don't just want function.\nAnd when it comes to sensory restoration,\nwe're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.\nAnd that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today.\n\n\n\n 0:56\n\n\nLikewise for hearing.\nWhen we think about why we hear,\nwe don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,\nalthough clearly that's an important thing.\nReally what we want to hear is music.\n\n\n\n 1:08\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 1:23\n\n\nSo many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.\nMany of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,\nwhen he wrote that.\nNow I'd like to impress upon you\nhow unusual it is that we can hear music.\nMusic is just one of the strangest things that there is.\nIt's acoustic vibrations in the air,\nlittle waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.\nSomehow in tickling our eardrum\nthat transmits energy down our hearing bones,\nwhich get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea\nand then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves\nthat somehow wind up in our brains\nas a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.\nThat process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.\nAnd we could discuss that topic alone for days\nto really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional\nfrom something that starts out as a vibration in the air?\n\n\n\n 2:13\n\n\nTurns out that if you have hearing loss,\nmost people that lose their hearing\nlose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.\nAnd it's at the hair cell level that they do this.\nNow if you had to pick a sense to lose,\nI have to be very honest with you\nand say, we're better at restoring hearing\nthan we are at restoring any sense that there is.\nIn fact, nothing even actually comes close\nto our ability to restore hearing.\nAnd as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients\nthat if you had to pick a sense to lose,\nwe are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.\nAs a musician, I can tell you\nthat if I had to have a cochlear implant,\nI'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,\nbecause I know that music would never sound the same to me.\n\n\n\n 2:54\n\n\nNow this is a video that I'm going to show you\nof a girl who's born deaf.\nShe's in a very supportive environment.\nHer mother's doing everything she can.\nOkay, play that video please.\n\n\n\n 3:05\n\n\n(Video) Mother: That's an owl.\nOwl, yeah.\nOwl. Owl.\nYeah.\nBaby. Baby.\nYou want it?\n(Kiss)\n\n\n\n 3:33\n\n\nCharles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child\nin terms of family support\nand simple infused learning,\nthere is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,\nhas in this world\nin terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.\nI'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.\nI'm saying that they're going to face obstacles\nthat most people who have normal hearing will not have to face.\n\n\n\n 3:55\n\n\nNow hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss\nhas really evolved in the past 200 years.\nI mean literally,\nthey used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears\nand stick funnels in.\nAnd that was the best you could do for hearing loss.\nBack then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.\nSo it's not too surprising\nthat there were no good treatments for hearing loss.\n\n\n\n 4:14\n\n\nAnd now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,\nwhich is an outpatient procedure.\nIt's surgically placed inside the inner ear.\nIt takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,\nunder general anesthesia.\nAnd in the end, you achieve something like this\nwhere an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.\nNow actually, this is quite crude\nin comparison to our regular inner ear.\n\n\n\n 4:33\n\n\nBut here is that same girl who is implanted now.\nThis is her 10 years later.\nAnd this is a video that was taken\nby my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.\nIf we could play this video please.\n\n\n\n 4:45\n\n\n(Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books?\n\n\n\n 4:47\n\n\nGirl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?)\nGirl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.)\n\n\n\n 4:54\n\n\nJN: Well this book has seven chapters,\nand the last chapter\nis entitled \"The Good Things About Being Deaf.\"\nDo you remember writing that chapter?\n\n\n\n 5:07\n\n\nGirl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.\n\n\n\n 5:10\n\n\nJN: Yeah.\nGirl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.\nSo it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.\n\n\n\n 5:20\n\n\nJN: I see. And who is that?\n\n\n\n 5:23\n\n\nGirl: Holly. (JN: Okay.)\n\n\n\n 5:25\n\n\nMother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister.\n\n\n\n 5:27\n\n\nJN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?\n\n\n\n 5:30\n\n\nGirl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.\n(Laughter)\nIt comes in handy.\n\n\n\n 5:37\n\n\nJN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there?\n\n\n\n 5:40\n\n\nGirl: No.\n\n\n\n 5:42\n\n\nCL: And so she's phenomenal.\nAnd there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.\nIt is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.\nHowever, despite this incredible facility\nthat some cochlear implant users display with language,\nyou turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.\nIn fact, most implant users really struggle\nand dislike music because it sounds so bad.\nAnd so when it comes to this idea\nof restoring beauty to somebody's life,\nwe have a long way to go when it comes to audition.\n\n\n\n 6:10\n\n\nNow there are a lot of reasons for that.\nI mentioned earlier the fact\nthat music is a different capacity because it's abstract.\nLanguage is very different. Language is very precise.\nIn fact, the whole reason we use it\nis because it has semantic-specificity.\nWhen you say a word,\nwhat you care is that word was perceived correctly.\nYou don't care that the word sounded pretty\nwhen it was spoken.\n\n\n\n 6:30\n\n\nMusic is entirely different.\nWhen you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?\nThere's really very little point in listening to music\nwhen it doesn't sound good to you.\nThe acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.\nAnd you can see on this figure,\nthat the frequency range\nand the decibel range, the dynamic range of music\nis far more heterogeneous.\nSo if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,\nwhat we would try to do\nis target it to be able to allow music transmission.\nBecause I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.\nIf you can hear music,\nyou should be able to hear anything.\n\n\n\n 7:03\n\n\nNow the problems begin first with pitch perception.\nI mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.\nAnd without the ability to perceive pitch well,\nmusic and melody is a very difficult thing to do —\nforget about a harmony and things like that.\nNow this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.\nNow if we could just play this.\n\n\n\n 7:21\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 7:45\n\n\nOkay, now if we consider\nthat in a cochlear implant patient\npitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,\nlet's see what happens here\nwhen we randomize this to within one semitone.\nWe would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.\nGo ahead and play this one.\n\n\n\n 8:02\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n 8:25\n\n\nNow my goal in showing you that\nis to show you that music is not robust to degradation.\nYou distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.\nAnd it might be that you kind of like that.\nThat's kind of hypnotic.\nBut it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.\nAnd you're not hearing the same thing\nthat most people who have normal hearing are hearing.\n\n\n\n 8:43\n\n\nNow the other issue comes with,\nnot just the ability to tell pitches apart,\nbut the ability to tell sounds apart.\nMost cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.\nIf we could play these two sound clips in succession.\n(Trumpet)\nThe trumpet.\nAnd the second one.\n(Violin)\nThat's a violin.\nThese have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.\nCochlear implant users cannot tell the difference\nbetween these instruments.\nThe sound quality, or the sound of the sound\nis how I like to describe timbre, tone color —\nthey cannot tell these things whatsoever.\nThis implant is not transmitting\nthe quality of music that usually provides things like warmth.\n\n\n\n 9:21\n\n\nNow if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant\nand you have them listen to speech,\nhave them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,\nwhat you find is that the auditory cortex\nis the most active during speech.\nYou would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,\nthey were designed for speech.\nBut actually if you look at melody,\nwhat you find is that there's very little cortical activity\nin implant users compared with normal hearing controls.\nSo for whatever reason,\nthis implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices\nduring melody perception.\n\n\n\n 9:51\n\n\nNow the next question is,\nwell how does it really sound?\nNow we've been doing some studies\nto really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.\nI'm going to play you two clips of Usher,\none which is normal\nand one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies\nand not even that many mid frequencies.\nGo ahead and play that.\n\n\n\n10:10\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n10:14\n\n\n(Limited Frequency Music)\n\n\n\n10:20\n\n\nI had patients tell me that those sound the same.\nThey cannot differentiate sound quality differences\nbetween those two clips.\nAgain, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.\n\n\n\n10:31\n\n\nNow the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?\nAnd yes, there is hope.\nNow I don't know if anybody knows who this is.\nThis is ... does somebody know?\nThis is Beethoven.\nNow why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?\nBecause his grave was exhumed.\nAnd it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died\nto try to look at the cause of his deafness,\nwhich is why he has molding clay\nand his skull is bulging out on the side there.\nBut Beethoven composed music\nlong after he lost his hearing.\nWhat that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,\nthe capacity for music remains.\nThe brains remain hardwired for music.\n\n\n\n11:10\n\n\nI've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo\nwhere I've been working on deaf cats that are white\nand trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.\nThis is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food.\n\n\n\n11:23\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n11:37\n\n\nText: Beethoven doesn't excite her.\n(Music)\nThe \"1812 Overture\" isn't worth waking for.\n(Trumpet)\nBut she jumps to action when called to duty!\n(Trumpet)\n\n\n\n12:14\n\n\nCL: Now I'm not suggesting\nthat the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.\nI'm suggesting that with training\nyou can imbue a musical sound with significance,\neven in a cat.\nIf we were to direct efforts\ntowards training cochlear implant users to hear music —\nbecause right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,\nno rehabilitative strategies,\nvery little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music —\nwe would come a long way.\n\n\n\n12:41\n\n\nNow I want to show you one last video.\nAnd this is of a student of mine named Joseph\nwho I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.\nHe's deaf, and he learned to play the piano\nafter he received the cochlear implant.\nAnd here's a video of Joseph.\n\n\n\n12:57\n\n\n(Music)\n\n\n\n13:41\n\n\n(Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.\nAnd at about four months old,\nI was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.\nNot long after,\nI was fitted with hearing aids.\nBut although these hearing aids\nwere the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,\nthey weren't very helpful.\nSo as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,\nand I couldn't really hear what people were saying.\nWhen I was 12 years old,\nI was one of the first few people in Singapore\nwho underwent cochlear implantation.\nAnd not long after I got my cochlear implant,\nI started learning how to play piano.\nAnd it was absolutely wonderful.\nSince then, I've never looked back.\n\n\n\n14:23\n\n\nCL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.\nHe is now a medical student at Yale University,\nand he's contemplating a surgical career —\none of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.\nThere are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.\nAnd this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.\nAnd the fact that he can play the piano like that\nis a testament to his brain.\nTruth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,\nbecause all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.\nYou don't actually have to hear it.\nI know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.\n(Laughter)\nAnd it's one of the most awful things —\nheartwarming, but awful.\n(Laughter)\nAnd so there is certainly a lot of hope,\nbut there's a lot more that needs to be done.\n\n\n\n15:05\n\n\nSo I just want to conclude with the following words.\nWhen it comes to restoration of hearing,\nwe have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.\nAnd we have a much longer way to go\nwhen it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.\nAnd let me tell you right now,\nit's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.\nBut I tell you, if we lost our hearing,\nif anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,\nyou would want perfect hearing back.\nYou wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.\nRestoration of basic sensory function is critical.\nAnd I don't mean to understate\nhow important it is to restore basic function.\nBut it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty\nwhere we can get inspiring.\nAnd I don't think that we should give up on beauty.\n\n\n\n15:44\n\n\nAnd I want to thank you for your time.\n\n\n\n15:46\n\n\n(Applause)\n\n"
